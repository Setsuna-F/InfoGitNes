sorry know supposed "art" film but wow handed guns screening people blow brains not watch although scene design photographic direction excellent story too painful watch absence sound track brutal loooonnnnng shots too long long watch people just sitting talking especially dialogue people complaining really hard time just getting film performances excellent but much dark sombre uninspired stuff thing liked maureen stapleton red dress dancing scene ripoff bergman i'm no fan f either think says enjoyed 1 1 2 hours well lying 
when little parents took theater interiors many watched parents but walked never seen interiors just recently lived rest life pretentious ponderous painfully boring piece 70's wine cheese tripe woody allen favorite directors but interiors far worst piece crap career unmistakable style ingmar berman allen gives dark angular muted insight lives family wrought psychological damage caused divorce estrangement career love non love halitosis film intentionally no comic relief no music drenched shadowy pathos film style best defined as expressionist nature using improvisational method dialogue illicit "more pronounced depth meaning truth" but woody allen no ingmar bergman film painfully slow dull but simply no connection sympathy any characters instead felt contempt parade shuffling whining nicotine stained martyrs perpetual quest identity amid backdrop cosmopolitan affluence baked brie intelligentsia story looms like fart room speaks affected platitudes elevated language cigarettes "lost" "struggling" desperate direction understanding just goes on point just want slap all it's never resolution it's interminable introspective babble nothing more than psychological drama taken extreme audience's ability connect woody allen chose make characters immersed feel left reason painfully self indulgent spiritually draining going but insistence promoting message prozac prose distorted film techniques jettisons past point relevance highly recommend you're feeling little too happy need remind death let's just pretend film never happened 
this film mediocre best angie harmon as funny as bag hammers bitchy demeanor "law order" carries failed attempt comedy charlie sheen come unscathed horrible anti comedy positive thing come mess charlie denise's marriage hopefully effort produces better results 
the film bad no way say story weak outdated especially country don't think most people know "walker" really care felt as watching 70's subject just not believable year 2007 set dc think rang true watched too as applause low quick end most didn't stay q either don't think schrader really thought film ahead time many scenes cut short as never finished just didn't know finish jumped scene try figure guess going really didn't woody's carter private life boyfriend either all "artistic" male bondage torture pictures iraq prisons thinking think very poor attempt trying create dark private subculture life woody's character car didn't work didn't make sense really good thing film woody harrelson played character car flawlessly really did great sense "walker" like say years ago great most likely never recognized as lauren lily kristin boring don't it painful unless true harrelson fan 
this film giant pant load paul schrader utterly lost bad screenplay directing as comatose as actually having sleepwalking process worst though woody harrelson ordinarily like he's properly cast plays "the walker" homosexual man d c plays social companion bored wives washington elite couldn't more dimensional cut magazine bounced camera popsicle stick "southern accent" "off rack" version decrescendos beginning end line delivers as though heat humidity south still draining ounce energy monotonous but not worst accent "boyfriend" played moritz bleibtreau attempts affect kind mid east accent clumsy barely deliver bad lines written incapable rolling r's spite fact real life german speaks languages italian that's kind good reason cast don't ya think story screenplay directing camera work performances leads bad beginning end tolerable moments film came supporting actresses lily tomlin lauren bacall kristin scott thomas managed make dignity tact fact all excellent spite trapped really bad film ufortunately no good enough redeem endless series flaws like actresses watch not worth time 
this line most boring years not woody harrison save sinking the murder supposed point interest but not nothing any interest cast not bad but script just plain awful just sat utter amazement thinking earth entertainingthe producers very clever boring but hid well names good actors actresses cast people blockbuster probably think woody harrison kristin scott thomas willem dafoe good rent boy horrible time like getting ripped rent people actually did enjoyed but like watch meaning
a worn plot man takes rap woman murder case + equally worn plot outsider inside eventually shut outstanding case think film rise hackneyed origins but scene scene drones no change intensity no character arcs inexplicable behavior homosexuality theme completely unnecessary hand completely unexplored included titillate viewers hollywood learn having gay characters does not automatically make more compelling picture regrettably dreadful lauren bacall pick good expected better kristin scott thomas definitely miss 
i saw drive in 1959 "howard duck" considered worst seen tried combine all genera comedy horror teenage angst hot rod sired "my mother car " maybe deserves second viewing accurate reflection it's time 
ghost dragstrip hollow typical 1950's teens turmoil not horror science fiction plot concerns group teens kicked "hot rod" club cannot meet rent kicked decide try old haunted house saving grace film "ghost" paul blaisdell creature suit turns work monster played blaisdell 
the worst seen tera jadoo chal gaya no story no humor no nothing action sequences more like series haphazard akshay kumar thumbs up advertisements stitched heavily influenced matrix kung fu hustle but very poorly executed did not lot expectations but watching exasperating experience makes wonder "what guys thinking " thing remember watching anorexic kareena bikini reason did not rating '1' time think seen worst bollywood proves wrong 
shame yash raj films aditya chopra lost intelligence years providing steady fare tripe piece cinematic crap thats not worth tube standards gritting teeth whole flick start finish schizophrenic direction plot line never quite materialized scene just felt ashamed country crorepati film makers "throw away" crores stupidity shame actors taking work commenting as piece work up saif ali khan completely disappointed choice film kareen shows enough skin puberty stricken akshay comes up as dim wit anil retard pubescent fascination english cronies commendable acting bizarre cinematography scattered 15 minutes enough pop blood vessel don't waste any brain cells energy money rent amu konkana sensharma instead beautiful piece independent film thats come india intelligent poignant wonderful story tale touch intelligent actors gave hope all not lost indian cinema making 
if 2008 product biggest production houses indian film industry yash raj afraid very long ahead reach right standards wrong length enormous star cast anil akshay saif kareena making still studied much harder associated film film lacks almost all departments except cinematography akshay kumar few good dialogues render but cannot make enjoy flick huge expectations scene car going river mountain very cheap graphics like cartoon film itself clear indicator director's vision actor asset simply wasted anil kapoor's gimmick attempting good english falls flat most times saif surely hit himself thinking signed short it's biggest waste resourses "jhoom barabar jhoom" say "aaja nachle" better enjoyable than cannot understand kind script written approved most unwanted flashback sequence akshay's love story faulty script weakest point music vishal shekhar given just filler tunes song songs start very well suddenly tunes drop drastically song "falak tak chal" good all lot opportunity wasted vishal shekhar regarding continuity intelligence makers just sample akshay saif road hilly area foreign location probably ladakh scene searching kareena haridwar hills kareena dicky car still thinking wrote manage sit till climax too long silly unnecessary stunts all heroes walking storm bullets not hurt as god still seeing 2008 all technical heights achieved no more words pathetic downgrade but sincere request senior actors fan dear anil kapoor akshay kumar possible ask preview copy as artists stature certain responsibilities fans viewers people still clap as enter screen scenes respectively think kind not daylight as hampers reputation all associated the actors production house 
i expectation nice star cast return duo akshay saif well hesitant watch man wrote story dhoom franchise hated dhoom 2 but dhoom 2 compared tashan say dhoom 2 very realistic saw credits beginning felt nice up nice way well very scene itself pis ed major drawback the action sequences friends laughing guts watching crappy fights like akshay against 30 thugs all thugs got machine guns phew got to understand bad action sequences thing the far too predictable story reminded early 80's well thing worth sexy kareena looked really hot rating 2 10 guys please don't thinking real gangster well watch laughs terrible fight scenes thats all 
the action beats sunny bhai gadar akshay kumar possess superpowers leonidus 300 neo matrix spiderman superman hilarious except typical akshay kumar anil kapoor comedy cannot positive film story looks like writer told 10yr old son write unreal anil kapoors long range shooting shotgun least most mistake director except directors tashan make no tashan regret wasting money not recommend anybody 1 10 least imdb zero 
i lot expectations more yashraj film jimmy operates centre day invited pooja singh teach boss lakhan singh english fall love decide run away but pooja tells jimmy can't as owes debt lakhan singh known as bhaiyyaji but decide steal money jimmy finds bhaiyyaji lakhan singh don meantime bhaiyyaji hires man bachchan pandey track jimmy pooja starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor akshaye kumar directed time director viay krishna acharya produced aditya chopra yash chopra "tashan" worse films watched yes scenery good kareena kapoor much publicised weight loss looks good but plot extremely thin story times makes no sense scene said beginning expected more film as yashraj production reference songs unfortunately not song remember moments laugh mainly thanks akshaye kumar saif definitely better while kareena kapoor played well but cannot said anil kapoor did not suit all as villain lastly never mind aditya chopra past produced directed good films as "mohabbatein " yash chopra doing producing trash conclusion bad not worth wasting time impression 
i no idea film saw tashan teaser trailers while promoted asked friends knew said "it directorial debut vijay krishna acharya wrote screenplays dhoom 1 2 saif ali khan's son ibrahim makes debut film playing as child flashback" watching understood wasn't proper trailer wasn't film story extremely dum 10 year old child come up better story line hardly any action camera shook possible angle it's difficult figure killing action daft unrealistic e g 1 man handgun managed kill 100 men machine guns while watching tashan reminded 3 films sin city opening credits koyla anil kapoor's terrible english like amrish puri koyla jhoom barabar jhoom outrageously ridiculous jokes not jot funny heard budget 40 crores as dhoom 2 don't know all money went did not like dhoom 2 absolutely no chance like tashan race hot heels million times better 2 good songs dil haara challiya songs shot greece good locations but use rubbish film anil kapoor's terrible english couldn't save discomfiture 
tashan title itself explains nature type actually flop shame yash raj films produces worthless than c grade c grade better pleasing story than tashan much hyped confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed box office certainly deserved view worst honourable yash raj films' banner come handled heavy project new vijay krishna acharya no actual sense making action flick tried imitate sanjay gadhvi's ways making like dhoom but suffered action scenes more like than comics cartoon exhausting audiences story loses meaning substances tenderly win audiences' hearts most scenes anil kapoor reminds southern tamil star rajnikant body languages wordly expressions not fan neither saif nor akshay but award kareena finally gone saif''s hand instead akshay just starting point expected but end displeased climax truth saif main whole adventure while akshay joins midst any final judged whole characters entire story award say reward given deserves credit tashan loses way unexpectedly failed hit akshay's nothing new comedian talent but still reminds previous seriously need form new image fans impress again again saif did great job race returned again hilarious nature but fully developed himself acting field but not least kareena looks really hot bikini dress complain as too lean but myself don't think instead slim yes slim good factor female attract major people say male nice saif's son ibrahim appears beginning as young saif hope too lean forward target making acting as career like tashan either mentally immatured still want to childhood say want admitted asylum thumbs debutante director vijay krishna acharya mishandled project offered yash raj films future experiment study script minimum 5 years going practical directions sorry don't like rate good stars type junk 
i just saw theater very few good points talk kareena's beauty couple songs thats complete disappointment all areas associated disappointed mumbai indians too just chennai semi final but worst feel the action scenes days bollywood trying copy action scenes hollywood but forget hollywood directors takes lot effect make look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors not much time spend time songs publicity too stupid action scenes work south as audience just pay watch favorite actor killing bunch people but bollywood certainly not going work all action scenes wish forwarded end chinese people appear beat akshay kumar height stupidity audience not paying watch stupidity think bollywood forget action cant make good action seen "ghatak" "khiladiyon ka khialdi" current scene bollywood really sad action fans like does people completion can't figure slow motion action using ropes too unrealistic childish better not action scenes cant handle just want to amitabh's era like zanjeer deewar having thrilling action scenes sound effect not very effective days but visually much better than current era scenes open eyes bollywood directors don't make any more action acquire art making realistic 
i very displeased terrible start comedy unhumorous action overdone songs unmelodious storyline weightless writer written successful scripts like guru dhoom high expectations actors worked way too hard did not help film all course kareena rocked screen bikini but seconds think hindi stunt directors research action tend exaggerate way too much chinese films style works signature piece but hindi cinema's signature songs good action no more than hours cannot look unrealistic but future i'm sure action much sharper noted comedy action films not mix unless properly good luck time 
if film worst year it's tashan promo gave indication film boring dhoom 2 style film well knew bad film maybe yashraj film maybe seeing cheesy promo but film gave shock worst dhoom 2 expected saif's introduction boring saif kareena meet kareena artificial anil kapoor oh god doing weird film kinda role acting doing scene alright but act gets repetitive overacts came akshay provided nice scenes but film more boring all outdated stuff childhood romance overdose childish rajnikant style action scenes all boring scenes ending jokevijay krishna acharya got 3 films more direct film worked thats strategy yashraj money nothing vijay addition list crap filmmakers music vishal shekhar ordinaryperformances akshay kumar comes film as whiff fresh air actually provides engaging moments saif ali khan irritating kareena equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously spoils more rest okay
absolutely awful utter waste time background music loud cannot understand speech well really listen closely speak actually unintelligible camera work bad editing not present background score gives headache action shoddy dialogs unintelligible acting abysmal well kareena used look like wrestler looks like starved wrestler hell slim but cannot gain grace spending hours watching want like but not allow pleasure want torture ahead watch 
sometime fail understand directors think make had trauma watching welcome 2007 thought wont again but loads amazing promos tashan finally ended as heart attack amazing 3 songs promo dil haara chhaliya tashan mein u zero story predictable plot plenty akshay kumar stunts nothing interesting apart watching kareena major weight loss music wise major disaster music album spent time giving pathetic small dialogs 4 jokers haven't thought giving background song scenes akshay kumar doing stunts song nice quite comparable tashan mein not taken music album sad plan watch say watch listen background song goes like 'bachchan bachchan pandey 'overall very disappointed way bhaiyyaji attempt speak bad english away man need puke 
i never thought standard yashraj films degrade extent film nonsense storyline catches no interest saif acted kareena improved figure but not good actress akshay good anil good say role wasn't good great deal cheapness filled wondered supposed "comedy part" just few flops does mean yashraj films make kind rubbish history many good films overall totally disappointed 
this horrible acting waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though scenery great always wanted to greece as saif you'd expect great performance but let people akshay kumar recognized as pimp bollywood voice singhs sensational this performance filmfare introduce award toiletries award worst performance way trophy toilet seat kareena kapoor all not comparable sister karisma acting looks body wants prove herself surpasses comes wearing bikini's tank tops short shorts really wonder saif ali khan letting wife dress like but must've impressed people dressing like ask consider man having erection watching dreaming having kareena kapoor bed naked condom including personally think dressed like whore but really liked forced 1 10 but i'd really 0 10 unachieved film

the sight kareena kapoor piece bikini thing wakes up sleep while watching tashan mega disappointing mind numbing new film cinemas weekend bad films bad films week but tashan not just bad film it's terrible film terrible takes audience granted terrible filmmakers expect away plot any common sense they've got big stars onboard written directed vijay krishna acharya tashan you'd as road but that's going all wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff centre executive who's hired teach english bhaiyyaji that's anil kapoor playing ambitious up gangster desperate cool jimmy's got eye pooja gangster's pretty young assistant played kareena kapoor uses jimmy swindle boss 25 crore rupees determined recover money punish jimmy pooja bhaiyyaji recruits most trusted henchman job akshay kumar as bachchan pandey gangster's faithful aide kanpur tracks culprits recovers stolen money that's hidden length breadth country much like bad eighties potboilers tashan too held threadbare script centred vendetta plot but treatment's top indulgent fails establish any connect instead coherent screenplay traditional act structure handful set pieces most scenes loosely constructed garish item song desert bullet dodging action scene rajasthani fort kareeena's bikini moment ridiculous climatic action scene complete shaolin monks water scooter zipping dirty naala believe not dhanno style horse driven tonga all fairness not all set pieces badly item song desert quite neat actually but very little makes any sense larger picture you're just going piece any help script really little expect seemingly fast paced road sickeningly sentimental flashback track childhood sweethearts problem tashan nobody associated film knew film making what's more don't think cared either film reeks arrogance arbitrarily packing elements genre actually bothering stop mix does work tashan like overcooked stew films kill softly there's tashan film kills excess packaged snazzily glossy finish camera work exotic locations fancy costumes frame film probably cost lakhs but still feels like hollow piece end story doesn't hold borrowing narrative tarantino style stephen chow doesn't help either don't blend film's wafer thin plot complained little less characters more engaging but anil kapoor's grating hinglish dialogue makes want slit wrists saif ali khan fumbles film foolishly unable feet kareena kapoor queen top delivery does decent job but course tashan salvaged extent it's thanks akshay kumar's irresistible presence spontaneous approach character cringe he's cupping crotch repeatedly scowl delivers double meaning dialogues but not moment eyes screen he's up despite good music vishal shekhar songs like they're prolonging misery well that's tashan test patience case didn't know tashan means style i'm sorry say film none 
such long awaited but disappointed friends gone the day trailers looked like action but turned out comedy bad comedy but thing deserves appreciation acting professional actors they've very well good acting but don't think save india shot beautifully kerala rajasthan ladakh all saturated color alright nevertheless way intrinsic beauty places shot want exactly places happy action sequences shot very shabbily no make head tail stunts they've used akki akshay kumar very well but could've much much better animation worst i've seen recent 90's better animation scenes guess initial scene car falling 'flying better word' road lake mentioned nearly 20 30 mins just make sure audiences don't forget guess 
i liked write story but wasn't any liked quote couple hard hitting dialogs but "hinglish" funny like 5 minutes overkill liked swoon 'keep u guessing suspense' but as predictable as um mm yash raj liked talk edge seat action but don't like cartoons much sigh all all perfect 1 people attempting suicide promise it'll push edge 2 sado masochists way more effective than barbed wire silas guy da vinci code wore 3 people researching alternative ways spread terrorism swear audience leaving hall mood kill 4 piraters more power any deserves not audience spending money watch 5 barnacles most types plankton green algae almost all living things require iq factor somewhat greater than offers afterthought director obviously species hope god kind enough things better 1 story 2 choreographer 3 screenplay writer 4 stunt coordinator 5 story did say 6 director preferably not mentally challenged although challenged better job 7 anil kapoor=bubonic plague avoid all costs 8 statutory warning "watching yash raj injurious mental health" things liked 1 kareena kapoor obvious reasons 2 english sub titles "mera dil kho gaya" "my heart void" "chaliya chaliya chaliya" turns "im flirt im lover im vagabond" priceless short tashan like opposite rubrics cube cube supposed increase iq player tashan promises lower iq mere 2 5 hours woot sigh but thats just wrong you've warned anyways 
this biggest flop 2008 don know director mind creating big disaster songs added situations story stretched 3 hrs gap most disgusting action stunts performed actors it's like having superpowers run bullets nothing happens person fighting 100 people best performance anil kapoor man all time best playing role villain comic act speaking hinglish akki good job but movieee just forget 
all world said film tashan good great pleasure but not case vijay krishna acharya serious mistake as actress kareena kapoor unbearable film tom boy look does not really goes well film story film not making sense all said quetin taratino india vijay but not all quetin talent anil kapoor involved stupid anil actor large caliber film not akshay kumar victim film as all saif style phoormola not really good film disappointed
i wasn't terribly impressed dante's 1st season offering "homecoming" wasn't much horror story but smart political statement undead screwfly situation story virus unleashed world causes men's sexual drive replaced murderous tendencies women episode starts all right short film explaining way screw fly killed scientists short scene man arrested females bodies discovered home assume supposed beginning outbreak but unclear never revisited episode ons while introducing characters blah blah blah cool mysterious but episode stars worse worse as lurches forward sad unsatisfying end worst episode well except chocolate 
i've written reviews moh episodes worst interesting premise beginning completely abandoned time credits roll watching people things never real life amuses "let's check basement " except it's not amusing entertaining it's just annoying extent virus never showed very much overlook fact affects men as resulting situation very very frightening but things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad home ultimately dies hands woman flees north runs few tens situations sort spirit alien appears saves things make huh huddling warmth end awful directors mailing tripe

a huge disappointment writer hamm director dante previous collaboration season's "homecoming" twisted darkly hilarious all right ways poor handling intriguing premise left bewildered supposed "payoff" showing generic aliens extracting brains infected psychopaths completely unsatisfying explained nothing point story extraterrestrial "cleaning" planet it's human infestation did gratuitously sadistic misogynistic fashion not just unleash completely lethal virus la stephen king's "the stand" instead having male population butcher females kept hoping episode improve as kept watching but just got more pretentious preposterous religious subtext simply forced but clear sam hamm thought profound weight gave like lot dante hamm's work but just unwatchable

the author sets "journey discovery" "roots" southern tobacco industry believes completely deservedly forgotten "bright leaf" ancestor not fact discovers nothing mild interest absolutely silly self indulgent glorified home suitable screening director's drunken family reunions but certainly not commercial non commercial release good reminder most independent films not picked up major studios boring irrelevant no interest but director immediate circles avoid all costs

i saw film premier sundance 09 american beauty say hopes towelhead unfortunately disappointment fact countless i've seen almost dozen sundance festivals towelhead sundance i've wanted walk early worst problem towelhead obviously originates collection "provocative" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes than organic human drama screenplay derives novel alicia erian famous edith wharton quote comes mind never known novel good enough good spite adapted author's political views observation especially devastating towelhead political views stale simplistic time towelhead's white male villains condescending portrayals blacks ironic treatments foreign cultures fresh it's long past more detailed review look up any many professional reviews available online almost all rate poorly expose shallow manipulative tissue based on hand amateur reviewers more easily bamboozled as read reviews similar sites you'll frequently come superlatives "stunning " "breathtaking " "profound " "shocking " embarrasses read but does not surprise i've encountered many people regard any book dealing racial cultural gender sexual issues as deeply moving thought provoking full profound insight person all means rent towelhead moved hand set standards higher safely pass 
unfortunately mistake paid 7 euros theater watch shallow meaningless points film based 2 things 1 ethnical point view as happens most american films writer thinks itself as expert learning 2 3 things asian culture but unfortunately not enough knowing kunefe 2 names foods doesn't make person understand culture example shaving sign clean life asia but trying girl stop lebanese people christian ok got cultural forms beliefs approaches completely different arabic countries main difference eastern western culture don't make ethnocentrism don't judge people question life as father figure did all film 2 sexual revolution girl nothing much say 10 girls sexual awakening than say wrong wrote comment producers promoting film black humor genre watch dr strangelove understand meaning black humor black humor reflect truth focus audience funny parts truth meaning

well writing very sloppy directing sloppier editing worse least hope editing acting wasn't bad but wasn't good either pretty much none characters likable least 45 minutes wasted time hour not used near full potential great idea but yet wasted good idea goes ended 3 different places but just kept going mostly predictable hollywood ending wasn't predictable badly didn't matter ending not worth watching all sandra bullock element stay away types looked rushed just wasn't really worth seeing paid very mad maybe more disappointed expected really good got bad all not horrifibly bad but wouldn't reccomend gave 2 10 b c liked idea much did like character justin believe super smart very cheap ways cover plot holes like trying cover volcano cheap masking tape not pretty wait $1 50 theater video unless like pretty much guess you'll like

so i'm wondering while watching film did producers save money sandra bullock's wardrobe dragging "before" clothes miss congeniality did ms bullock sleepwalk role channeling "before" gracie hart as many reviewers noted film very formulaic add deja vu viewer experiences character cassie maywether as somewhat darker gracie hart more story rapidly snooze fest bad boy serial killers better films as "good guy partner trying protect partner despite evidence" character seen fact none characters film dimensions try but trite stereotypes peeve using term serial killer false advertising murdering person it's premeditated murder does not make serial killer potential serial killer but not serial killer spree killer 
alfred hitchcock invented any kind thriller think set standards high any director makes suspense fatally compared main subject bullock vehicle all ideas almost hitchcock's classic " rope" students commit gratuitous crime nietsche's philosophy clues boys disseminate master transfer screen eighty minute technical riveting tour force "murder numbers " does not place single room like "the rope" mind supreme originality pits cops against evil youngsters never guess cops very different actually bullock plays woman living like man partner chaplin as shy as clueless girlie boys' performances not really mind boggling not as good as say edward norton "primal fear" well know " rope" good

i can't believe managed relatively high rating 6 barely watchable unbelievably boring certainly worst films seen long long time no budget way reminded star wars episodes ii sheer impression watching total creative train wreck film avoided all costs it's "festival films" pseudo intellectuals badly people think makes "different" therefore good bad film making not "different" it's just bad film making 
this confused incoherent mess interminable scenes boring dialogues monologues no exaggeration make tremendous effort try involved sincerely thought fassbinder make interesting order tell does erwin elvira suicides end but instead scene somebody trying explain "when young happened " "he just came casablanca ordered cut " soon erwin elvira slaughter house talking friend prostitute certainly slaughter house best place pleasant little chat while telling story elvira's life fassbinder shows killing cow difficult choose giving attention disturbing images transvestite saying course come very forced coarse symbolism "i suffered much life die" sparse moments actually happens erwin elvira encounters lover performing extremely gay choreography guys as going necessary level homosexuality recognizes elvira interesting shots ideas admit as nun tells story young erwin but wasted fassbinder's self indulgence 
it's funny i've seen bunch fassbinder films extremely creative interesting while repellent self indulgent messes like film ranges great crap much middle know lot fans "sophisticated" but can't help but think lot appeal pure hype point view know lot negative ratings too many too quickly too self indulgent gay gender bending films like tend really bad sloppily quite boring as querelle bitter tears petra von kant just gross like film couldn't message acceptance person's gender confusion handled better than showing slapped watching cows gruesomely slaughtered sensitivity subject matter make characters more human sympathetic maybe i'd care films i'm honestly point watching film not bother any more fassbinder films bad weighing good

how many more fake "slice life" need hopefully not too many raising victor vargas very self conscious attempt director peter solett garnering attention hollywood nothing wrong general wrong film particular ignores audience piles clich book supposedly "edgy" hollywood independent production it's supposed "real" left shake camera "documentary style" except no documentarian shake camera purpose it's "edgy" let's not waste any time lighting film it's "hip" let's children use swear words like al pacino scarface so forth all left very self conscious attempt impressing hollywood won't impress outside "rarefied" indie crowd still heap acclaim bad film 
ok know lot people probably resent review as watership "classic" standard most people's childhood but seeing film time tender age 18 admit really hated watched film sister read book really enjoyed many people whimpered very words "watership down" memories seeing film as children having emotions torn seams recommended honest wish hadn't bothered gave benefit doubt generally don't like stop watching film half way exception really really excruciatingly sickeningly dull film possibly slowest thing i've watched imagine doped up snail space really didn't "do it" art alright backgrounds nicely not little bland twee yet rabbits not very endearing animation quite jumpy poorly produced i'm not going huge details storyline basically tale group rabbits leave warren infiltration humans area generally moralistic story perils human interactions environment uses anthropomorphic rabbits message kind wished gassed not i'm horrible sadistic person but characters uninspiring annoying dull generally quite rude oh i'm terribly english constantly looking clock whilst watching film took whole 20 minutes actually happened terrible anticlimax praise any way i'd admit concept showing children perils building countryside hopefully unveiling arrogance humans quite well meaning maybe all general sanctimonious preachy but message it's trying forth good nature musical score not bad too conclude film pretty poor couldn't watch whole way i'd probably forced eat legs sheer boredom granted isn't "torque" bad but still doesn't rate highly eyes i've given 2 10 hope helps 
i saw as very young girl i'm 27 scared witless years nightmares aspect film way drawn music obviously violence parents still argue allowed watch say never let watch think say knowing strong feelings 0 currently reading book morbid curiosity fact it's classic really great story however don't think cartoon well maybe kids nowadays quaint but gave nightmares weeks weeks still hard time seeing rabbits drawn similar way gives little heart palpitation time yah wuss but strongly suggest any parent looking to kids read book instead watch make certain approve content not finds as disturbing as did but 0 
firstly not easily scared except few phobias but absolutely horrific not appropriate children all mouth open whole time just shocked couldn't believe gory children's bunnies brutally murdered it's just unnecessary horrifying rated g recommend 8 but don't wrong probably good wasn't scarred mentally as child cannot believe parent allow let's say 4 year old child watch it's just intense complicated not forget gory young kids i'm wayy 4 shocked violence don't recommend
so it's really sexist classist thought not beginning stages like stella tells steven really like change herself begin speaking right way tells not change well certainly changed tune reviewers followed suit beginning appears love story really social placement women as sacrificial mothers end does not make hero makes whole thing sad sad people think makes hero comment people away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents social conscience yuck

raising victor vargas fails terribly tries most real unfortunately no reality film characters situations feel completely artificial fake reason bad directing peter sollett uses all wrong tools arsenal mr sollett read not lighting film authentic feel wrong just gives badly feel similarly shaking camera does not documentary style film just gives audience headache detracts what's screen instead enhance course what's screen painfully fake as mr sollett wrote script goal trying look "hip" sundance buddies "edgy" filmmaker overall lasting impression film leaves bad director mr sollett time taking few writing directing classes 
interesting read comments viewers regarding omega code many overwhelmingly positive comments lifted almost word word tbn broadcasts looks as directly video stocked rapture series religious group 70s dont remember wont remember either year seen implied religious duty to buy as many tickets as possible save souls very shameful just goes televangelist's son too play high roller hollywood producer lil ole ladies tithe money 
this film much promise very excited film end laughable best painful worst acting styles ran gamut really really flat angels wife daughter animated casper's character felt dialogue just attempt transfer information audience instead real people trying talk pay special attention scene regarding "the bug" it's pretty much insult audience's ability figure things defense scene though got biggest laugh whole read spent alot money traveling various overseas locations too bad didn't make use didn't feel like transported exotic locations anybody insert stock footage coliseum rome however end positive note thought sets pretty good really liked graphics displayed decoding computers opinion that's all schmaltz factor much much lower action factor greatly increased film good

i didn't know expect film well know truly awful film screenplay directing acting equally bad story silly stupid director smart thought provoking film but didn't squirmed seat half bad focus film film christians boycott film instead promoting it shabbily waste money not film 
yes admit cried incredibly disappointing couldn't help myself but tbn trinity broadcasting network again having million dollar man ex professional wrestler program omega code follows stream sketchy religiously oriented quite amusing yet time disturbing biblically inaccurate follows known as "the bible code" than following actual biblical scripture film extremely poorly writing directing hilariously horrible acting depressing people actually effort appeared more like late night watch usa channel straight home video than theatrical released highly recommend not watch life depended 
 basks too much innocence doesn't tell story it's more big time snooze fest while actors all personable story trite goes think victor rasuk great charisma but deserves real film real storyteller 
what left say i've read all reviews most right however person went far as evil satan tainted lines evil wow shocker mean tbn basically film open eyes anway very lowest grade propoghanda nonsense come years most terrifying thing omega code much money spent make no limits therefore no choice but ready "yentl 2" "ernest loses omega codes "for biblical stories new dogma pickup omega code never started 
quite honestly omega code worst seen very long time 30 minutes sat stunned seat trying decide demand refund but hadn't paid place passes figured as well stay didn't think possibly any worse did quickly run low points includes spoilers horrible miscasting casper van dien as gillen lane motivational speaker phds characterization inconsistent example lane despite credentials complete nitwit there's lame o depiction fulfillment biblical prophecies bunch sensational news soundbites accompanied ridiculous print outs translated biblical code terrible "action" sequences lane escapes tough situations explanation time lane actually does danger turns dream sequence that's cute grammar school writing assignments but it's inexcusable plot device motion picture pacing bad long opener changes scenes 90 seconds later pacing improves but still far too much unnecessary jumping as mentioned years pass yet no not lane's young daughter ages disconcerting few good things though quality film e g lack graininess high very attractive outdoor shots well location shooting added touch realism few moments the film lane calls god finally help proved quite exhilarating does not accept jesus as personal savior but liked struck as genuine scene unfortunately followed major incomprehensibility characters dialogue direction acting all poorly michael ironside nothing michael york just weird think producers wanted too much plot tighter more focused characterization more fleshed film far better nutshell omega code disappoints definitely not pay stars 
i known trouble casper van diem as lead character words cannot nor justice just terrible but allow try horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations all feeling force fed beliefs propeganda trinity broadcasting network weak attempt trying hollywood entertaining deep religious message attached failed miserably clearly worst seen long time 
i youth pastor's wife took youth film spent hour trying explain didn't didn't enjoy it based concept run all major religions world bible code torah code code koran questionable as laughable not step forward christians arts step forward believe check brains door 
i'm christian always skeptical christians however as rule "know nothings" comes production admire tbn trying present god jesus positive honest way screen however did hideous job acting horrible unless familiar bible fashion not understood trying not terribly but people facts wrong however "critique" facts irrelevent too deep delve short omega code absolute worst seen not recommend except comic relief day grind

i very disappointed film few reasons half hour it's actually pretty decent although acting isn't any better rap video kinda funny production value doesn't half bad fact almost thought almost as good as perico ripiao recent dominican film turned much much better than expected plot revolves not just cheating husbands but women viewed treated dominican society as whole makes good premise especially dominican republic unfortunately don't think makers film relies good all treat subject matter f'ing butchered veal cutlet 30 minutes the roles men women reversed main characters wife puts kind spell as result cheating habits not does transition happen look cutting edge space age cgi effects dating i'm guessing 70's but whole plot just goes drain rest nothing but cheesy predictable situations clever liners top all guess warn spoiler alert all turns dream oh didn't coming oh man almost forgot most ridiculous thing well hour start thinking "hmmmm just doesn't right sound track but " hits half music taken video game called king fighter 95 oh dr film work art comedy match france's amelie action flick match thailand's ong bak animation as akira japan witty crime thriller as layer cake england socio awakening journey as waking life states 1 but i've seen much worse come dr search los jodedores you'll know i'm talking 
someone explain film features poor people adopts pseudo gritty look seen as "realistic" people didn't realistic characters although actors did best really bad parts situations instead saw forced self conscious effort "edgy" "gritty" "down dirty" sadly takes lot more than hand holding camera rhyme reason failing light film achieve any qualities any significant way it's sad commentary state independent film distribution films inside theater nowadays all carbon copies bad cinematography non existent camera direction lot swearing striving pass as "art" it's little wonder films like "in bedroom" "about schmidt" raves meandering very average but compared current slew independent clones like "raising victor vargas" outright brilliant inspired few years ago seeing "independent" film meant likely treated originality lot energy care maybe few technical glitches caused low budgets nowadays means chances you'll yet numbers let's shake camera hours attempt placating lack taste independent distributors course all serve characters situations completely unreal contrived any surprise independent marketplace fewer fewer surviving companies not all films like raising victor vargas nothing but copy worst films preceded

darkly comic serendipity cosmetics saleswoman odd ties elvis presley running sea elvis impersonators while speaking conventions nevada accidentally killing little fault kim basinger still attractive actress considerable merit likes pick quirky play but dreadful screenplay mitchell ganem adam michael garber hasn't iota good humor stereotypes low ball gags not meant stuff classic comedy but shambling shameful level picture crude sloppy watch count much extraneous shots basinger wheel pink cadillac hands always position non plussed look face hopefully elvis well paid no stars 
omg reason i'm giving 2 instead 1 tom hanks funny as elvis box apart did halfway decent cast sign lame maybe like good idea time no laughs mention stereotypes pathetic cast wasted direction amateurish think most blame probably lies director joel zwick brings nothing but flat performances all involved don't waste time like did but enjoy good train wreck geez telling need more lines ya called return sender okay funnier than 
elvis left building he's lucky didn't watch unfunny stinker scene scene director joel zwick finds ways make unfunny script less amusing filled unfunny deaths trite gay characteratures hack jokes film more desperate than amusing sort film makes hope kim basinger follows doris day premature retirement let remember way talented not she's david leisure delicious dennis richards rest all wasted talents zwick finds way minimize talents turn guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than king really good bit casting young girl plays basinger as preteen really looks like actually pretty good reason watch film all look tom hanks cameo cameo isn't all funny but least not painful wonder zwick incriminating pictures hanks make 
i notice previous reviewer appears still school gave very good review assume reviewer hasn't seen far superior 1989 bbc adaptation classic novel major problem 1999 version casting anthony way as tom long anthony way talented boy treble shot fame appearing tv mini series "the choir" assume cast role tom long strength excellent acting "the choir" unfortunately small boy appeared "the choir" grown tall gangly youth time "tom's midnight garden" filmed as anthony fails convince as schoolboy tom too far stretch imagination believe tom as played anthony befriend far younger hatty 1989 bbc version tom hatty much closer age development friendship much more believable 1999 special effects fail convince not any noticeable improvement 1989 tv effects casting acting version inferior earlier adaptation all all lack lustre version true classic as final observation point vhs 1989 bbc version fetches well 20 00 second hand whereas new dvd version bought under 5 00 need say more 
if like bad it's incredibly low budget special effects you'll mean use non actors gave film it's charm you're bored group friends highly recommend renting b gem it's mulletrific

no fireworks despite violent action science fiction films reflect quality scarce largely transposal imaginative themes genre screen too often falls short effective execution as result insufficient funding inadequate invention unfortunately producers work lacking counts woefully case essentially no budget operate grave mistake attempt depiction gamut events as scenario particular special effects space opera warfare appear clownish while seeds scriptors' imagination lie fallow most fatuous misunderstanding basic scientific principles frequent firing weapons sealed environment wayward law gravity enables freedom movement cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly but easier accept than pretend any episodes basis plausibility plot involves escape life sentenced prisoners space station penal colony waste landfill moon various attempts obtain passage earth few capable players present execrably directed timer paolo mazzucato production team wastes effort as holographic pornography while ignoring pressing basic requirement creation states suspense impetus

this time hero film human time uses fist foot combos against super universal soldiers gone awry prepared world i'm pretty sure double team convinced jean claude van damme no longer credible providing watchable action flicks however tarnished credibility forever while universal soldier return isn't as dull as double team quest it's still pretty awful none style flair original no star pairing sequel simply kids enjoy professional wrestling as look not action sequences all exciting therefore worthless dud words clunker van damme's assembly line 4 bad 
this atrocious waste time no plot acting far par used as exemplar acting classes not merely commercial rip earlier universal soldier scrapes the acting barrel sad vd needs assert ego few years sadder still people pay good money sit kind schlock gives martial arts bad comparison makes segall norris arnold look almost talented vd leslie nielson track send ups genre least laughing instead 
after seeing low budget shittier versions "universal soldier" franchise hoped prayed van damme reprised role as luc devoreaux second unisol well prayer answered but not way hoped universial soldier 2 just intense as poetry reading local library no more intriguing fight sequences top notch bruce lee quality redeeming factor entire pathetic excuse motion picture having wcw tough guy legend "goldberg" playing villain however placing goldberg as seth's sidekick lieutenant would've better offended most setting itself it's like film school students slapped plot holes bigger than kanye west's ego really did example luc's daughter hillary looks like she's least 11 13 years old filmed seven years ago possible tell luc's partner killed turned unisol just goddamn diculous mean tell experimental unisol exposed naked basement research complex beginning c'mon director could've spent more time like sewn all plot holes shut but oooh nooo speaking plot sucks compared universal soldier 2's plot watered worthless where's gritty thrills unisol goes berserk enacts memories supermarket rampage thinking desert storm dawn millennium attracted more audience taken place dystopia orwellian type future cesspit corny correct adjective sad sad sad sequel seen double impact under siege 2 robocop 3 hell cheap ass no class terminator knock "class 1999" more entertaining than 
jean claude van damme tries rescue career making sequel universal soldier but did saved think goes hell dies minute inside facility bad guy film scary huh but not as scary as acting details following van damme black girl not remember well doesn't matter trying escape muscle men course new universal soldiers more muscels less brain just like while van damme fights goldberg but "mission" gets aborted just test test nerves turns van damme works government new universal soldier project seen think most unlogical thing yould van dammes character but sequel "story" come up ah forgot daughter very important "story" well 20 minutes super hears conversation shutting quitting project course cube gets angry activates all soldiers kill van damme escapes facility but sends soldiers hunting wants van damme as soldier best really guess goldberg hunters always silly sentence audience gets asskicked funny yes just like rest film "story" van damme tries rescue daughter wife reporter comes final van damme fights bad guy most expensive scene whole just too funny tell you'll waste time not watch but sixpack 
i don't think any van damme's beat universal soldier but u never know good but not as good as 1st vd returns luc battle again tries 2 b funny but maybe worth smirk chuckle vd kid time ally w good showed pic 2 goldberg cool does famous forgot called cause don't watch wrestling sucks vd goldberg good fights ending like 1st but just not good vd does best career like always helicopter kick though final ending should've longer worth seeing but never top original

terrible acting potter flat plot no tension as feminist polemic it's laughable saw garbage released though tedious belief i'm glad did that's immediate answer question 'what's worst film you've seen ' plus comfort knowing film rest life better than tango lesson but admit impressed way potter wrote script garner maximum number arts council grants world as revealed closing credits very recently saw orlando potter learnt wrong lessons making film all took bunch frilly costumes few hard stares camera leading lady loose plot seduce cinema going public shouldn't think away self indulgent nothingness tango lesson 
this worst seen seen quite few passed as art film but really piece trash it's redeeming quality beautiful tango dancing but cannot make up sally potter's disgustingly obvious tribute herself plot nonexistent guarantee start laughing end especially starts singing it's absolutely unreal 
strange less than 2 hours like lifetime sitting flat uninspiring drivel story as personal as supposedly sally potter wouldn't expect little passion performance acting completely detached felt no chemistry sally pablo tango scenes fiery given nature dance instead awkward painful watch obviously revealing personal story film daunting as sally potter wise let better actor task than let passion fall victim sheepishness 
dire just dire script contrived acting painful story just drags doubt celebration sally potter little wouldn't bad but she's director writer star film just self glorification myself not caring developing romance principal characters ending came not moment too soon redeeming features lot shots really quite lovely particularly paris look good black white secondly you're fan tango not music large excellent except sally starts singing watch film risk need unintentional laugh sure appeals statistically 
probably encouraged admirers much better "orlando" potter delivers vehicle herself worst way writes directs stars actually writes music including mawkish love song film strongly resembles high school college project teenager convinced intimate loves melodramatic obsessions as fascinating as but potter's character as unsympathetic as object romantic obsession unlikable whole film embarrassing display narcissism masquerading as celebration tango hadn't cast herself worked just can't act playing herself not pretentious ambitious dull silly 
the film severely awful demeaning rape victims surface daring film rape but dig beneath surface lies not positive message rape aishwarya rape victim shown helpless victim cannot cope all woman needs man help society makes jibes throws comments does not stand up herself all left anil kapoor all talking while aishwarya does all crying director satish kaushik went wrong path portraying rape victim as weak submissive more effective portraying strong woman rebels against enemies courageous way director famous chauvinistic films usually full weak women but tries hide controversial roles needs learn just role controversial does not mean character herself strong most degrading scene film aishwarya 'cleans' herself just raped does father thinks dirty though commendable shah shows stigma against rape victims stark light does not ash's father wrong making daughter thing thus left confusing message rape comedy too not needed strong subject film like more comedy simply not funny ash wooden role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout music mediocre except title track beautifully picturised bright point film sonali bendre's role disappointing pointless overall great remember ends up awful mish mash viewers severe indigestion 
 but lousy film as maltin says christopher lee's attempt make serious horror film well serious too serious plot silly slow old people inhabiting bodies young children achieve immortality film all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk things over again actually dozed few times film sooooo dull cast sleepwalks sole exceptions peter cushing lee but probably labor love often complained horror too violent well no violence avoid all costs unless insomnia sleep 
in good review loleralacartelort7890 says "the truth americans use secret aluminum anti radiation alloy not well known exact specifications secret secret well reveal space race russians very dumb reveal new technology shield crew against radiation " completely incorrect no "secret" radiation protection apollo design construction apollo command module long publicly available uses lightweight "honeycomb" aluminum stainless steel entire outer surface except windows course covered heat shield phenolic resin thicker faces forward entry materials actually better stopping kind radiation space charged particles than lead better suited stopping ionizing photons like x rays gamma rays space radiation definite problem long term space flight risk big solar flares but simply wasn't serious threat apollo astronauts command module gave pretty good protection brief 1 2 hour passage van allen belts all carried dosimeters know exactly much radiation received no more than 1 5 rem usually much less 24 men flew moon 12 landed 18 still alive died cancer alan shepard leukemia jack swigert bone cancer rest died heart attacks pancreatitis roosa motorcycle accident conrad actually pretty good statistics group men late 70s shepard 86 
i 11th grader high school current world affairs class kid class video suggested watch did firm believer went moon father works nasa though think biggest piece crap watched guy created serious balls all did jfk getting shot dare use all biblical quotes good thing sparks debates good b c class weekly debates did nothing change mind think michael moore working make michael moore called "a funny thing happened spetember 11th" "a funny thing happened way white house" 
this documentary founded sponge cake as soon as any real evidence integrity slowly sinks big pile crap example bart sibrel claims multiple lighting sources shadows appear crossing case wouldn't more shadows object apollo 11 went van allan radiation belts spent 30 min's not 90 min's claimed documentary received dose radiation more equivalent an x ray seriously research learn really happened don't let pile crap documentary mold opinion really happened
i notice most people think film speaks truth either not born moon landings 1969 1972 not old enough appreciate think much easier question historic event did not live youngster time apollo but old enough understand going entire world followed moon landings families gathered tv watch launch newspaper headlines screamed latest goings day launch landing moonwalks moon liftoff all way splashdown multitude languages school classes cancelled watch main events tv apollo 13 world prayed held collective breath as men limped home uncertain fate couldn't asking latest world truly community buffer 30 odd years fact easy claim fraud worldwide enthusiasm interest died left history books anybody claim history wrong attempt "prove" bunch lies up facts while completely ignoring preponderance evidence showing not mention proof dwells souls memories lived wonderfully heady fantastic days 
this called "documentary" tries tell usa faked moon landing year right all actually studied case knows different all definitely proof astronauts moon brought many pounds rock moon geological studies spread world hundreds labs tested all concluded came planet not earth inner isotopes basic elements different earth but similar calculated moon e conspiracy theorists never studies thing fit theory ignores rest wrongful claim wind hangar shot moon landing e flag moves logical explanation astronaut moved hand moved proves well conspiracy theorists studied footage flag never moves astronaut let e conspiracy theorists bad scientists cant study subject properly studies came make lie make profit e called "documentary" claim says cant possible filmed moon all shadows come different places different light sources artificial lighting studio again conspiracy theorists wrong as usual happen earth desert night no light sources but doubt any conspiracy theorists outside grandmothers basement more than many days star treck convention held conspiracy theorists denial big time want make up all lies important fact 
the reason didn't score sibrel does adept technical aspects making film technically adept film having said film based lies distortions quite easily disproven most documentary spent using propaganda techniques bash space program than actual fact sibrel's "irrefutable proof" landings faked easily refuted know orbital mechanics not recommend watching but google video free don't let bart sibrel profit curiosity 
when 16 saw documentary "a funny thing happened way moon" actually liked believed couple years but grew up began think sought more information more info reel sources non biased sources started university not long ago asked assistant professor astronomy conspiracy theories said shocked said all theories lies baffled did not believe but presented evidence claims quickly debunked most theories subject "humans did not moon" most outrages claim apollo craft not travel van allen radiation belt crew perishing radiation truth americans use secret aluminum anti radiation alloy not well known exact specifications secret secret well reveal space race russians very dumb reveal new technology shield crew against radiation biggest evidence all moon stones apollo missions did moon brought many rocks moon to geologists similar scientists documenting all things moon rocks stones fact moon internal basic elements all matter consist of special isotopes different quarry quarry land land especially planet planet isotopes rocks stones proved not come earth astronauts brought home hundreds kilogram's rocks all proved come outside earth planet ergo moon landings not fake nasa did planet moon though not planet but satellite planet moon duuh rocks distributed laboratories universities all world proved humans did moon fact pronto but not worry most conspiracy theorists generally unemployed uneducated mostly not know lie facts fact remains humans did walk moon 
the views earth claimed film faked nasa recently compared historical weather data time apollo 11 good match cloud patterns video sequence actual rainfall records day undermine entire argument forward film "whole earth" picture actually small planet framed spacecraft window waiting bart sibrel claim historical weather data faked nasa though no doubt involve replacing archived newspaper copy weather map ones private hands still problem ah response "trying discredit referring nasa weather data i'd say charming but weak gullible argument rest footage proofs certain wise man said sifting mosquitoes swallowing camels any way feel maybe apply trying happy just packed irrefutable evidence against claim u s government moon missions success man true masters universe things nearly never quite just watch dear say you'll things bit different than "first weather data doesn't come nasa comes met agencies world second weather data undermines major claim film far "packed irrefutable evidence" remaining claims film thoroughly debunked sibrel thought previously secret piece film edited added interpretation unfortunately source film public domain bits sibrel edited contradict claims 
there many incorrect statements called "documentary" myself shouting television bart sibrel able produce flashy looking dvd but sadly lacking looking science claims relies either inaccurate not telling full story old favourite "government always lies us" innuendos people believing told not checking accuracy details claims what's more "exclusive" "unreleased" footage freely available internet various sites further reading circumstances regarding filming production shows used false pretenses gain interviews used creative editing responses order promote opinions all claims mr sibrel "inaccuracies" "mistakes" "whistleblowing" apollo programme thoroughly disproven 40 odd minutes life 
i watched video friend's house i'm glad did not waste money buying video cover scene 1975 capricorn starts clips rocket blow ups most not related manned flight sibrel's smoking gun short video clip astronauts preparing video broadcast edits voice instead letting listen crew say video curiously ends showing zapruder film claims radiation shielding star photography lead believe extremely ignorant sort ax grind against nasa astronauts american general science bad video 
writer director bart sibrel bases work film says mistakenly sent nasa says shows astronauts faking television footage trip moon employing camera tricks astronauts low earth orbit all time editors ground composed raw footage just few seconds finished film unfortunately sibrel's research slipshod doesn't realize "backstage" footage really taken large 30 minute live telecast reel seen millions not hidden away nasa vaults as implies wonder sibrel puts conspiratorial narration astronauts' audio footage hearing astronauts words clearly spells astronauts just testing camera not faking footage finally raw footage having buy sibrel's hacked up version shows more zapruder film jfk's assassination than "smoking gun" sibrel thinks he's who's seen what's more revealing clips raw footage sibrel chose not use as clearly showing appropriately distant earth eclipsed window frames forth destroying claim mattes transparencies placed spacecraft windows create illusion faraway earth as most films type sibrel relies innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary selective quotation manipulate viewer accepting conclusion not shred actual evidence 
there remark heroines raped "drunken rampage" russian soldiers completely untrue not shown statement kgb prosecuted "jews gypsies etc" "worse than nazis" kgb looking called "zionist" agents kgb believed imperialist agents totally different targeting jewry as whole nation as nazis did gypsies never prosecuted kgb political tool used politically but internationalist standpoint communists really did not distinguish nationalities whole stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs berlin contains typographical errors kgb general looks totally phony called "russian proverbs" totally up list goes on not recommended watch full lies phony stuff "good shepherd" instead 
i regret bought series expected more action more objective picture more consistency just pure propaganda series very dark any charm romanticism just boredom itself actors work quite weak as well o'donnell charming as robin batman but picture lacks any charm probably while older loosing childish charm but does not gain any charm grown up comes as no surprise not shown lot countries sold uk 40% recommended price not released netherlands 
proof not tarantino touches turns gold most definitely plastic all way easy quentin's involvement probably sat shelf years that's assuming got produced place woman fascination death gets job cleaning up crime scenes angela jones unconvincing role william baldwin better as serial killer keeps jones employment all all pretty poor 
thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing talented angela jones deeply unfunny garbage it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed chance make film rules based script help quentin tarantino himself creates like feels story worth telling world doesn't deserve second break under circumstances performances good actors they're told well it's just shouldn't place 0 4 
excruciatingly slow paced scripted black comedy too clever premise bad acting maybe worked as twilight zone tales crypt episode but half just want to predictable ending 
geordies salt earth characters bricklayers beer geordies happy lucky adventures working abroad salt earth characters warm wonderful people tyne bridge tear eye brown ale salt earth characters cute little red indians children newcastle united tops emetic geordies salt earth characters poor know better timothy spall can't paid much as jimmy nail well kindest thing said bit as good 'actor' as singer writer come jimmy joke's 'crocodile shoes' 'spender' very funny unfortunately don't think supposed 'auf wiedersehen pet' opposite applies 
usually i'm bit fan bad eighties early nineties film featuring beens but film incredibly terrible real endurance test sit guys dressing up as girls death but never pathetically corey haim's performance abysmal as usual nicole eggert not much better no redeeming qualities number 1 fan actor actress piece trash stay away

this doubt worst horror i've seen that's saying lot considering i've seen stinkers like demon paradise lovers' lane bloody murder close second however love bad horror as tell username really sticks times there's nothing more entertaining than poorly slasher flick as film opening scene woman gets fried tanning booth appears no bearing film whatsoever especially fails tell event happened 2 years prior rest film acting nonexistent most camera shot women's areas shrink wrapped spandex policeman most stone faced monotone actor i've seen best worst however murder weapon giant safety pin thinking who's killer disgruntled "huggies" employee i'd overall zero but darned didn't blast watching it

mst 3000 worst acted seen all shooter no bank account no history leaving army 1993 pays rent cash no way hell person like allowed close president not mention high profile job head security pothus not emotional start drinking haze president shot sucked cannot express extremite single actor terrible chick trailer park crap garbage waste time 
it all clichs of type no substance plot went end felt like sucker watching production good however script acting b quality casting poor good actors mixed crumby actors good actors didn't hold nor did lift up not worthy more words but say more meet minimum requirement lines james wood cuba gooding jr play caricatures looking mindless entertainment still wouldn't recommend 
this like bad indie list talent plot silly all way end reminded very much churned home video market 1980's given but brief moments actors really really straining make worthwhile think worst thing underwater scene's held dock underwater lighting come no supposed care close running air air tank kind appear avoid unless nothing shelf good day 
this ranks as worst i've seen years cuba angie acting actually embarrassing wasn't archer decent actress happened action decent but completely implausible make up bad it's worth mentioning mean thinks makeup contemporary feature film tell make up artist dop you're not supposed actually ending massive disappointment lines "and realized all dream"don't waste time money you're better just staring space 2 hours 
you figure star's listed wrong opening credits not good time credit reads "cuba gooding j r " nice car chase shoot 'em up blow 'em up action all want action relationship plot exists tenuous best completely unbelievable motivations characters especially gooding's end worse unbelievable irrational not hopelessly muddled all think andy cheng really nice guy many good actors foul project can't all 
spoilers aheadthis worst it's simple not redeeming quality 10 minutes quite tricky actually lead believe film shocking edge seat instead spend 83 minutes punching while watching stolen poorly scenes run any organization lake ridiculous looked like aquarium plant different parts lake bed characters advanced teleportation powers example alex thomas falls lake drunk ends up boat impossible position angie harmon up pitiful performance as kate worse space time continuum rupturing dialog appears written minute fifth grader example said "flashlight " stupid manner shows threshold much human body cringe snaps half finally editing far most bizarre horrific seen like cameramen bunch chimps given camcorders scientists example suddenly closeup headlight alex's car bet little no time spent editing ending absolutely pathetic writers obviously trying create sort mysterious plot line viewer say "oh yeah " instead we're left view dumb painting spider fits story line unfortunately not perspective millions save festering piece crap 5 10 5 fact recorded film instead picture book

where start probably worst seen editing worst sound effects awful sound editing whacked most all crappy kicking effects muddled talking background turn volume full blast just going supposed hear exactly probably worst scripts can't believe people actually up green film makes think crap box send producers finance dolph usual dolph nothing needs said villains bad protagonists bad stinker really want know not either writing directing editing watch 
i can't think much say film awful can't tell decide view it few redeeming qualities don't know begin plot moved implausible downright absurd entire body tense duration not wait awful thing end myself feeling relieved editing poor acting sub par storyline weak francoise robinson cast as native american though does not closely resemble native american heritage going idiotic laughably stupid very least wasn't just pathetic 
i seen bad austin powers spy shagged batman forever but film awful boring got half way not bear watching rest pity boasting talent as kenneth branagh embeth davitz robert duvall story john grisham went wrong branagh big time lawyer night fling davitz father duvall psychopath hanged cat branagh sent nuthouse promptly escapes couldn't figure robert downey jr daryl hannah famke janssen tom berenger all mixed story moves slower than stationary wanted like huge grisham fan read all foolishly expected interesting honestly worst film i've seen date wish money refunded 
dolph lundgren stars as templar comes new york key unlocks anti christ archaeologist course demon couple miles dolph isn't killed easily as transfers body body like fallen suspense course lundgren element completely unwatchable admit fan dolph lundgren like steven seagal jean claude van damme try watch they're tv caught minion boy disappointed utterly terrible action sequences poorly staged badly edited barely make coherent sense fight arena worst all lundgren's woefully unconvincing perf as tough guy priest all worse rip fallen good end days bad but better than overall worst i've seen dolph lundgren literally nothing recommend it's awful it's lowest point lundgren's career saw cover up warrior masters universe 1 2 4 awful 
this doubt worst emphasize whats worse old hero dolph hes starring jesus story actually quite good but way carried body hurt fighting scenes starters as well choreographed as fight drunks slugging gutter actors except dolph kinda sucks perform badly cant help but wonder reason theyre all friends director way absent most not all time 12 million spent unimaginable way look effects scenery cost cant cent 1000 
come let's real knights christ ordo templi knights templar as more commonly called did not exist early 12th century story laughable it's pathetic dolph lundgren just looked positively bored wanted real life templar not just use knights christ still existence portugal least taken history account redeeming quality artifacts looked authentic enough pass medieval gothic period pieces acting bad storyline appalling action horrible props okay 
for funniest comedians awful fast forwarded never got any better waste time waste money tina fey great writer thought great comedy previews great but showed best parts husband thought chick flick sucked up very slow ans boring not recommend time like money boo arizona thanks but no thanks does kind stupid stuff make people think pregnant thought going funny children helped children more lines reality

this perfect example great going awfully bad advice watch well kinda obliged fact tiff competition still can't believe won remained end director q section but but interesting what's well half worth watching presents characters hooker musician kind official lie professions but actual liar second half don't ruin good evening includes old breasts heavy drinking but maybe completely different tiff jury did drinking vodka 
as much as dislike saying 'me too' response comments it's completely true 30 minutes film nothing whatsoever endless dirge comprises following 90 having banned doesn't make film watchable just doesn't resemble hollywood product does not make credible worse yet addition no discernible plot than lots muddy places russia many people very old women drink lots vodka number visuals unnecessarily nauseating i'm second package rolaids as spoilers well film devoid any narrative thread couldn't write tried don't waste time money don't confuse good russian cinema 
i agree previous comment beginning quite good get's wandering come nothing all open story lines remain open characters like importance completely left picture save 1 2 very short scenes wander ilya wouldn't better just completely leave as remaining character nothing either just visits god awful place suddenly isn't anymore but geriatric witches spend days making dolls bread drinking homemade vodka apparently flashing say does well showing society crumbling like judges iffr but just bad taste bad camera work lousy script frightfully bad direction therefor not as generous as predecessor comes grading 1 
let start saying consider myself more most open minded viewers passion big regular local cult rental place feel need add often ask advice never able leave place having elaborate discussion exchange ideas going cult area love rent strange stuff exactly recommended guys cult video place told thought cover said jodorowsky favorites atmosphere rented vote gave not really fair did not think awful just did not know rate question mark more appropriate film literally sick stomach actually felt physically ill stomach literally turned still did not want turn maybe just couldn't fascinated nasty way not wanna again not awful 1 as said just not cup tea wodka matter 
film starts 3 people meeting bar ok they're talking imaginary lives lying all time no reason still ok time time make laugh interesting 30 minutes actually enjoy but things worse nothing's happening long time happen all naked old "ladies" touching not ok disgusting way top but it's except no point it's boring sick strangest thing belgrade serbia fest film festival most popular according researches course people watched thought watching "hay interesting although it's russian movie" but god no 
the basically story russian prostitute's return home village funeral sister friend couple minor story lines actually more interesting than taken but not fully explored core the funeral wake later controversy future community crones make dolls sell buy vodka but missing artist dolls marketable apparently unedited prostitute's journey city village excruciatingly endless train ride tramp mud maybe that's supposed impress immensity russian landscape village itself as is inhabited legion widows male consort dead girl continuing doll business problematic involved eventually impossible most film shot hand held camera induce nausea problem western viewers subtitles don't include songs laments crones don't unless you're fluent russian 
the starts quite intriguing scene people drinking making small talk bar all making up bit outrageous stories as unfolds turns most outrageous story true however not very interesting except scene bar scene main secret revealed revelation happens barely half time frankly not much left seen rest time director lingering god forsaken russian village full pitiful creepy old ladies sure fascinating bit shocking images but admiring goes way too long sacrificing any possible plot character development as example either lousy lazy making instead trying make interesting story makers concentrate weirdly fascinating imagery few almost unrelated stories case point meat trader's story leave spectator figure all odds ends surface artsy appearance but particular case nothing more than lack talent 
i can't believe much talent wasted gingerbread man starts right foot manages build up great expectations ending but point turns worst stories i've wasted time it's just unbelievably bewitched mallory doss manages pull kenneth branagh's character nose climax as uninteresting flat as beer left sun too long gingerbread man probably worst grisham isn't changed fact talented stars crowd don't waste time 
i tried sit bomb not too long ago disaster acting atrocious absolutely pathetic action scenes fell flat as lead balloon mainly fact reactions actors just didn't ring true supposedly modern reworking hitchcock original "lifeboat" think hictcock spinning circles grave very thought able suffer nothing compelling boasts few semi big names but no effort characters but know fair nobody's fault really mean i'm pretty sure script blew up explosion lol possible thing ends up improving as goes but i'm not willing spend least days unless least day weekend horizon avoid stinker 1 10
this film really bad script full 'memorable' lines incredibly bad performances special effects bad not worst ones seen either music bad listen to believe just short themes 30 seconds long repeated constantly whole film all all worst films seen 
this probably worst seen things immediately jump 1 woods more like hills los angeles couple trees brush not scary whatsoever news flash filming southern california area big bear hour away actually trees 2 writing absolutely doubt worst dialogue experienced possible line unoriginal clich just plain stupid instance the camp "camp blood" lame the clown "the killer clown" lame clown doing forest mask 3 but certainly least acting absolutely worst group actors actresses assembled virtual cornucopia shitty lines poor acting worst far randomly flash fat foreign girl getting naked photograph it's really long scene guess supposed sexy but not few enjoyable parts tool supposed "athletic " instance bored grabs couple rocks starts doing curls later supposed running clown immediately clear very "girl like" run quite far athletic oh girl played kat good lord stop singing song sang credits makes want kill myself reason least recommend watching special features group jackasses film talk as really original story fact girls actually says let friends read screenplay none predict ending apparently hangs special kids 
why did waste money day sundance want refund $16 while watching film kept waiting happen nothing did happen way knew supposed reading plot not really like film did director zoom handy cam zoom not very artistic did director lulu filing nails minutes actors tried speak sounded like reading point felt like phantom love no story all honest felt like friends vacation videos much higher entertainment value than film 
this film disappointing blurb decide phantom love called expected arty thoughtful beautiful imagery did interesting images but often random no sense fact like inserted time end effect listless believe film meant atmospheric but just wasn't lack coherent plot did not help matters say mysterious but think just incoherent no atmosphere main character disturbed but plot did not draw enough care situation looking cast list not known main character as child film very little context time place character not prude but sex scenes pointless confused further recognised lulu but not sure man different men lover husband prostitute saw credits discovered hairy meant belong lover film did manage make shocking dream sequences involving lulu's mother bit boring nail filing actually more sense as did indication lulu's emotional state not fault actors as don't lot work not know lack context flow film ineptitude pretentious but end result dull can't bothered talking anymore

this makes canadians brits asinine moronic idiots men stoned drunk yell beat up almost scene women superfluous story not understand they spend scene causing ruckus worse milling like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women either quarrelsome vulgar tramps hulking hippie chicks it's standard knocked up girlfriend loser boyfriend wicked mother ludicrousness seen countless character carping infantile stereotype not mention all looked like need shower idea any kind scene implying sex george wendt shudder enough make gag watched samuel west but cannot understand accepted role like maybe needed money ian tracey superb actor vague redeeming moment but talent wasted as rest plot imbeciles trying dope yawn karl dead but actually character very much alive minds left almost like rebecca alfred hitchcock's masterpiece although ashamed thought compare films bother karl galling circumstances death gratifying end wretched thought all better going boat 
i shelf while housesitting bored people possibly 10 it's not just it's supposed feel good redemption film think doesn't work level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there's just nothing harvey keitel decent but nothing work bridget fonda especially johnathon schaech just terrible plot progression especially relationship byron ashley makes no sense like writers wanted plot certain way actually writing necessary bits make flow it's hour half but that's 90 minutes life you'll never 
this worst seen branaugh much trouble remembering accent couldn't deliver lines plot definitely not worthy john grisham's no wonder never published as book released theaters didn't watch whole thing decided didn't care realized no "whodunit" care 
might contain possible spoilers not film new mildly surprise matter does disney feel need recycle oblivion sure it's cheaper but while wouldn't think overall quality way people think drop house villains despicable display cartoon crossovers make absolutely no sense all signs total disregard previous films voices don't remotely match up iago evil again know films directly children but time all enjoy disney films movie's musical number disney's specialty years stunk wouldn't recommend film very young all more caliber released it's matter time small animation studio surpasses disney overall quality 
have not watched kids films years missed "here come tigers" came never saw "bad news bears" though '70s worked guys arranged financing "warriors " "man king " "rocky horror picture " like check old small people gone great careers despite less than great early just minutes no more jumped end credits young actor gone bigger better things least watching appearance create interest as plot acting weren't doing job lo behold spied wes craven's credits as electrical gaffer he'd early shockers but not yet created freddie krueger "scream" maybe owed favor helped pic more surprising fred j lincoln cast credits as "aesop " wacky character f j lincoln '70s just few years ago appeared produced adult films associated adult spoof "the ozporns " just title funnier than all "tigers" attempts humor combined let fact adult actor placed kids indication as people making asleep wheel 
the saddest fact 87 minutes i'll never knew terrible guy dressed as lunatic indian chief top roof away 2008 10 year old boy really baseball right decided rent rainy day though enjoy parts cringe heard all needless foul language bad bad awful ripoff bad news bears completely shameless completely predictable don't mind predictable it's well but absolutely not 
i just watched horrid thing tv needless say watch just much worse frankly don't know much lower bar characters composed lame stereo type obvious attempt creating "bad news bears" embarrassing say very least seen prized turkeys time but no reason list any "numero uno" let way watched vanilla ice bad funny this not good 
what stinkeroo turned time much earlier career linda darnell favorites no great shakes as actress but very beautiful pleasant particularly films like "the mark zorro" "blood sand" but saw monstrosity memories golden days faded quickly story unbelievable farcical acting second rate supporting cast insufferable cannot think more immature performance compared tab hunter donald gray most boring leading man picked added terrible photography not just referring color associated shuddered shown

wow great cast julia roberts john cusack christopher walken catherine zeta jones hank azaria what's script say you're just greedy surely charismatic bunch thespians weave fetching tapestries cinematic wonder script unnecessary you'd think but no america's sweethearts missed opportunity it's like involved woke up day's writing shooting editing though "you know i've working pretty hard lately guaranteed hit all big names right i'm just gonna cruise let somebody carry " much potential yet painful sit isn't single aspect thing doesn't suck julia's fat suit lame 
let way balls bollo ks truly awful more embarrassing than attempts satirise julia roberts skilled actress usually work highest standard lacking direction struggles look proficient normally consummate professional yet swear eyes signs bewilderment despair thing rescued idea director chris walken turning secret documentary actors unfortunately theme wasn't explored it's full potential too little too late zeta jones wooden cusack cusack crystal stick acting talented ex buffy stars different experiences green hopelessly mis cast balfour under used well julia just preventing worst 
and mean ultra light film features giant stars half jokes nothing really isn't too much say stinker than although couple really good bits most isn't very funny nor does work all as romance as romantic comedy not life most dialogue way too flat sophisticated much less amusing what's really ashame premise not bad all much more especially all recent focus bogus ways films promoted complete phony quotes critics film uncovers mined territory press junket all expense paid trips journalists almost always write nice reviews but instead exploring motherlode jokes devotes all minutes territory moves pursuit film's lame romance catherine zeta jones' character whinny self centered star zeta jones does good job she's given but she's given practically nothing it's all homogenized junk looks very pale comparison things we've heard stars years end hard understand zeta jones julia roberts john cusack billy crystal sign aboard doomed ship sinks like rerun "the love boat " fact as old joke goes forgotten script filmed deal probably make better story ahead tell filmmakers stars got appear

would tell shaq stick good basketball not entertaining stupid level shaq plays genie lives boom box not orginal genie boom box instead lamp supposed help little boy played equally annoying francais cappra most flimsy storyline water world acting awful think likes flim afraid admit 
this film proves "commercial" cinema hollywood serious crisis absolutely no reason produced apart fact somebody expected success based shaquille's no worth referring plot bit more perplexed than knot screen somewhat dim o'neal bad actor but francis capra worse rating 1 10 
there genie played shaq kazaam whack rhymes corny lines bad stupid kid cryin stupid dad bad actin bad casting bad special effects whats sucks prolly didn't make 20 bucks lives boombox not lamp hurts like cramp like wet food stamp yeah stupid rhyming genie can't act stupid horrible special effects oh confusing as hell i'm not gonna let's just say belongs "its bad funny" category watch buddies good laugh but don't expect spectacular 
yes kazaam horribly bad almost reminds wrong not just kids but humanity shaq as rapping genie yes rapping genie does making bad puns dressing ridiculous outfits all ending in christ like pose lots light surrounding yeah expect really cheesy bits including wish lot junk food falling sky regrettably not knocking main characters particularly kid not expected film kid shaquille o'neill incredibly schmaltzy main plot film involves kid played all too typical annoying kid fashion great grandson frank capra kid yelling dialog angrily comes genie who's trapped boom box "hiarity ensues" as kid makes shaq genie quasi slave as waits wishes as tries make amends shady gang type absentee father really sappy contrived son father story bad enough as certain lines uttered million e "two chances life" speech father son but it's shaquille o'neill reason watch film ironically obvious sinking crux all plot line involves not getting talky treatment capra rap dialog start blossoming recording career top kicks ass takes names main bad guys want boom box camp factor up point but squashed all mushy scenes 'heart felt' moments really no business rest material ask people making obviously doing behest popularity basketball player wanted michael jordan acting bandwagon near decently entertaining convincing i'd hope too knew just getting paid but i'd hope more felt least little guilty afterwords feeding shaq machine want fun night shaq as genie turned rapper turned wisecracker all more fun hell interesting shaq night critically acclaimed effort steel but you're hoping few brain cells stay away very likely worst flick 1996 candidate many worst 90's 
this so horrible makes angels lose wings shaq tried make crossover efforts like work shaq fu nes plethora unbearable rap albums later epic serving horrible film making steel there's not single good thing said saw bunch times very young but must've idiot takes all enjoyable films tears apart it's fun mock saw disney channel while spent few minutes doing although thrill mocking still overwhelmed terribleness tv try consider as watching film removing all scenes shaq uses magical genie powers like film pedophile chasing kid rapping seduce that's kinda funny disturbing horrible example film not unless looking mock

as "jane eyre" fan excited came "at " thought "someone make book following story actually written author " wrong casting director intending cast "jane" plain certainly succeeded however surely act tension jane rochester spooky suspense novel laughter floated night seemingly sparkle child flirted danced like mother finally plot changed end wonders screenwriters actually read book disappointment
i love book "jane eyre" seen many versions all strong points faults however worst seen didn't care jane mr rochester charlotte gainsbourg jane almost tolerable certainly looked plain but no emotion any lines couldn't imagine mr rochester saw brings mr rochester william hurt less emotion than jane possible insipid people fall love mystery but certainly didn't hold attention director zeffrelli fell asleep production timothy dalton too handsome mr rochester version far more faithful book but ciaran hinds plays perfect mr rochester 1997 e version not all true book trying positive geraldine chaplain perfect role 
oh just needed 19th century england pretty much like regular england nobody's vandalising football stadiums picturesque setting lords dames randomly chosen titles charlotte gainsbourg walks aimlessly as jane eyre novel nobody read willingly jane usually hangs mr rochester's crib tries teach french girl look chalkboard all time day mr rochester william hurt auto pilot comes fall love jane all but there's still matter fruitcake wife locked attic oops wasn't brochure people thrown carefully spread probably rented set finally comes end looked really authentic that's guess but again nah 
having read novel seeing film enormously disappointed wooden acting arrogance producers blatant disregard plot feel film no way reflects brilliance bronte's work gave impression shallow love story condensing film short 2hours film lost many key features make book comprehendable progressional thus resulting somewhat jumpy plot little grounding no build up romance rochester jane eyre appears abrupt unfounded characters infrequent interaction cannot help but imagine 'love' superficial injustice bronte's novel given no impression jane's quirky cheek boldness attracts rochester arrogance attracts jane despite poor scripting think few characters portrayed very astutely mrs fairfax grace poole however overall production poor given better scripting film more successful "jane eyre" 1970 zelah clarke timothy dalton outstanding production 
what franco zeffirelli thinking hollywood responsible travesty comfort idea didn't speak english as language just completely missed point charlotte bronte's classic don't think improve comment read i'll just paraphrase "jane eyre great great book screenwriter read " it's true movie's leads sadly miscast but pity actors screenwriter left all best scenes dialog makes understand jane rochester meeting minds shared sense fun deleted script marriage proposal fortune teller gone allusions half joking half sincerely felt jane as fairy sprite olde england come rescue rochester despair eliminated unfortunate zeffirelli felt need completely rewrite end novel jane's interactions rivers family but unforgivable surgically removed love best love stories written favor 1983 mini series timothy dalton 
i read novel 'jane eyre' time 1986 round time saw bbc version timothy dalton zelah clarke excellent version very much like book years later laid eyes version horrified william hurt totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester passionate character as william hurt portrays as block ice goes charlotte gainsborough like watching zombies story love passion but couldn't version no bbc version wonderful time guaranteed 
jane eyre greatest novels english language screenwriter read hate writers use spark notes novel all unbearable watch read book whole 'red room' played wonder bother in book 'red room' foreshadowing whole story rest jane's life helen burns treated badly i'm sure happy die leave early book most compelling characters not red head whole christian theme missing life rest favor miss read story as charlotte bronte masterfully told 
i don't like using word "awful" any work cinema great deal time effort talent money spent creation but zefferelli's attempt adapt charlotte bront's novel 'jane eyre' total waste time script lacking finesse power explained viewer no uncertain terms leaving little imagination lead actors woefully miscast clearly hired star names musical score drippy dull charlotte gainsbourg william hurt absolutely no chemistry all like wet noodle worse than joan fontaine least capable modicum emotional involvement story frustrated passion william hurt acts entire film tone tone flat devoid energy course limp vapid script does not aid any fine actors efforts bring any whiff life flick joan plowright's mrs fairfax like disney creation keeps popping up sweeten scenes best left no mystery surrounding story rochester's wife role second wife played like barbie doll elle macphearson cipher fiona shaw very great actress completely wasted as jane's aunt mrs reed better cast as mrs fairfax amanda root as jane's beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy believability saw version 'jane eyre' viewing robert young's british television 1997 starring ciaran hinds samantha morgan gemma jones no comparison young's vital romantic deeply moving version like exploding nova compared zefferelli's wet squib interested 1970 version timothy dalton i've read very good things web site amazed many people liked zefferelli's yorkshire picture book all say good film house beautiful cinematography vividly colored complete dud 
this version pretty insipid i'm afraid jane eyre favorite books childhood but william hurt's weary throwaway acting style completely unsuitable bold passion edward rochester poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like bored petulant teenager dental braces hurt can't believe eliminated edward's great marriage proposal scene end book most moving moments literature appreciate finally used young plain woman play jane character supposed worldly 18 but want version closer approximates personalities passions novel 70's version george c scott susannah york york too old tall pretty play jane but no touched rochester's character way scott did 
what idea seeing attractive hope live up charlotte bronte's brilliance original classic story deeply disappointed either written filmed great haste not qualities original novel powerful much witty forth main characters jane eyre mr rochester either missing screenplay left cutting room floor missing jane eyre's charismatic sense self enabled suffer turmoil triumph all original jane eyre hero woman did not much triumph including greatest parts story jane runs away thornfield mr rochester struggle food shelter shame having beg bread threat freezing death cold all away man loved opinion poignant parts story simply left title character dry uninspired story unappealing did not read book cannot imagine story least bit interesting screenplay direction did little any credit classic story

a friend lent video fairly excited watch but minutes james hetfield's slow pitched vocals lars banging drum set appeared slow motion began think `why watching ' question coursing minds 5 10 minutes hit play gave tape day as suspect not worth buying watching just opinion 
saw 'film' recently say worst attempt film making misfortune hell going coolio totally unprovoked shooting people distress totally uninvolving slow tedious detached worse than spawn long live "evil dead ii" 
what hell d bad acting bad special effects worst dialogues storyline came cool thing coolio nice cameo as freaked cop however rest film awful boring it's not bad laugh just plain crap compares evil dead series as well compare tomb raider indiana jones well ok least angelina jolie tomb raider 1 10
this bad it's basically overdone copy michael jackson's thriller video worse special effects consist lots glow dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots lots growling think dog best actor whole

i wish say unusual it's banality but usual way dumb husband smarter but boring conventional wife idiotic sidekick "comic" relief sorely needs stale predictable jokes more predictable reactions laughtrack punctuate noxious mental narcotic's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines leave either physically ill deep sleep more resembling induced coma but while yet gives average american personage truly identify "regular" guy just like live southern u s just opposite escapism obnoxious character form seeing television brutal overkill 
this certainly worst saw beginning somewhat good but end still don't magical power 300 years later goddess dancing f acting somewhat not bad but place better sure 
shown australia as 'hydrosphere' incredibly bad bad hypnotised watch end just any worse does storyline predictable written high school dramatics class sets pathetic but marginally better than miniatures acting wooden infant 'muppet' stolen props cupboard 'total recall' didn't single original idea whole bad laughed most way malcolm mcdowell hang head shame obviously needed money 
this absolutely pointless good esamples malcom mcdowall never got decent role clockwork orange one worst though no story crappy special effects shot 4 3 worse cropped dvd just avoid 
this probably worst bad acting bad special effects bad plot bad 15 minutes cat suited cyborg introduced muddles malcom macdowell needed make house payment sell himself hollywood blvd pay just don"t know clockwork orange crap able look mirror morning better special effects bathtub there's no continuity editor asleep drugs bad acting smoke bad gun either shoots blue flames bullets make up mind bad girl girl look much alike confusing whay called 2013 seadly wake nothing movie
there reasons did not 1 reason actors like malcolm mcdowell gwynyth walsh work tried play usually good level acting however many scenes blocked bad scripting reason cool idea looking cyborg quite different most roles i've seen far as bad as boring scenes useless boring dialogs bad script work as many actors interesting story though but failed completely 
if mr cranky rated i'd tempted just copy review paste but as hasn't i'll myself thing giving 1 instead 0 malcolm mcdowall's acting excellent however not save film disaster director really distracted worked just conglomeration scenes thrown very little continuity reminiscent bad '70's worse actors director appeared making up as went probably showed bad original script it's not worth discussing story line although revolves futuristic corporation called proxate corporation crew dispensable people carry dangerous cargo old container slave ship nigeria ship's baby kept glass jar wired crew usb 12 company called prostate corporation as entertainment value par examination honestly can't scene say well made any real sense context watched end as touch bird flu reminded people actually worse than malcolm mcdowall particular won't hold against as he's great actor great actor entitled bad career doosie unless shop hires you're male you're doctor isn't doing prostate examinations week feel bad thing really wide berth unless course you're really community minded buy copy support malcolm use as drink coaster 
this worst written i've sit story's nothing new but it's cartoon cares as long as it's pretty fun i'm not going as deep as characterisations i'll all day except say aren't any characters change personality it's convenient plot but wrote script visual direction forbidden access much as pencil paper thumbs i'd vote cut thumbs "narrow object prop cut character close up character gives knowing look audience not remotely understand repeat times different objects props ""make characters pay no attention all huge lumps rock floating crashing generally raining destruction all kill all any moment but make stop gasp fear harmless looking almost pastoral green rock distance "the whole thing long succession events actions behaviour convenience writer save having think make any effort all write story properly plan 9 cg cartoons except doesn't ed wood groan factor make fun watch favour spend cartoon budget pixar 
terrible use scene cuts all continuity lost either awful scripting lethargic direction villainous robot musta jazz dancer worst sound tracks i've heard monologues usually drowned music where'd props ship looks like milk carton did better special effects 8mm age 13 i'd recommend any film student watch flick 5 minutes time as learn not produce film editors' fault it's really too bad scenario actually good concept just poorly executed all way sorry malcom sent "stunt double" you're too good actor stink bomb 
a terrible containing bevy d list canadian actors self conscious fact camera performances overly melodramatic quite forgettable film badly written badly edited badly directed disjointed incomprehensible bizarre but not good way mcdowell does great job given but film really bad story script work it's not camp enough funny yet van pelleske act credible manner sub characters like eisen nasal whiny voice confirm lot toronto than barge africa didn't director 'creature' looks like jazz dancer alien suit fight blue bolts lightning pelleske's orange wisps 'magic' lack better word obviously result bad actors no choreographer overlaid completely derivative special effects director set editing room disaster film not good kind learn mistakes don't waste time you'll regret like did nothing more say waste celluloid 
the deadly wake perfect film students learn not make film let's did crew mess up flick worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting let's face "film" ultra high contrast black white silent still awful all scenes dark lighting people "black" often music score drowned meandering dialogs ok nobody spoke whole sentences long pauses effect "evil" robot hilarious jazz dancing oh guess supposed walking tactically i'm sure struck fear hearts poor editors edit much footage garbage not possible garbage garbage no matter splice did dailys line couldn't stand watch more than 15 minute segments bad but did whole thing lotsa breaks just any good parts all nope none perfect example not make flick serious film student 
this "so bad good" films always hear but never unlike troma films deliberately bad campy not amused 100% pure serious however features as supposedly super lethal killer robot prances like solid gold dancers acid trip magical mate calls lightning transforms good witch east fact takes itself seriously pushes far edge bad makes full circle entertaining watcheable enough 
i just watched high definition television wheelchair neuromuscular disorder like watch few films physical disabilities main character somewhat noble captivating message disabled life time spent fighting disabled recognized integrated mainstream society's job market great problem isn't real person did things great man but film completely hypocritical diametrically opposed very message preaching insulting all didn't cast title role actual physical disability sure competent actors but completely dis genuine preach hiring disabled not actually hiring disabled film further compounded fact scene mid way film man seen walking podium crutches appearing leg but cgi scene apparent shameful couldn't actual amputee film 5 second shot more financially sound cgi effects than just hire actual amputee point film fraudulent completely against message trying convey came bitch whine like pathetic cripple figure 
disappointing undeniably dull true crime poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling way title role jeffrey dahmer easily century's most recognizable degenerates serial killers released straight video early 2003 "dahmer" overtly talky boring badly acted virtually bloodless snore fest true crime drama never truly delves monstrous demented psyche late mass murderer like perfectly good potential does however attempt reasons unknown evoke sort sympathy viewer man portraying ultimately lonely nebbishy severely socially inept homosexual loser simply lookin' love all wrong places as opposed cold calculating depraved sicko madman overall 2003's "dahmer" true crime buffs as well skip i'm not kidding say it's worst serial killer biopics it's sorrier than pathetic exploitive straight video trash like "gacy" "bundy" "ed gein" "the night stalker" turkey zero stars 
oh make beauty but terribly bad mean uwe boll doesn't make crap like not hint decent story multi layered characters attraction it's just random sequence pointless chatter joined make 'movie' suppose children up 3 years age enjoy given world utterly dimensionless story incoherent older annoyed but again it's far too scary under 6 years age there's probably no watch all advice stay far far away little daughter make better storyline though probably isn't able draw pictures pretty tales much more worth listening believe not expose children piece i'll 2 10 that's exclusively graphics story character development awful they'd deserve negative rating decide watch anyways remember warned 
it morbidly fascinating look life america's most notorious serial killers but sadly doesn't come close terrible editing direction bad acting literally 10 minutes plot stretched 100 redeeming quality bruce davidson as father but that's not nearly enough save stinker 1 10 
curiosity led "masterpiece" unfortunately didn't rent bought most disturbing thing film it's not disturbing reasons known makers film set human jeffry dahmer kidding man gave new meaning term "finger lickin' good" all flash backs flash forwards trouble following story all all jeremy renner's performance wasn't too bad catch "s w t " plays disgruntled ex cop rate as 1 10 got 1 renner's so performance plenty books tv documentaries much better job covering dahmer's crimes avoid 
way ace just chilling grossly intriguing story necrophiliac cannibal soft mellow drama obviously called dahmer kinds horror documentary right neither wasn't close any detailed facts fact barely any substance all wasn't really morbid scary didn't try very disturbing as would've try hell writer director thinking here's most real examples sick serial killers badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes lengthy droning flashbacks time old parent's house think jacobson actually trying present invent 'the soft side' j dahmer 
this much potential followed story jeffrey knows many details overlooked it's ridiculous too much time effort spent dahmer's homosexual tendencies alcohol consumption character development origins any villain always interesting dahmer no exception does address adolescence began killing mutilating small animals instead giving dizzying array flashbacks seek explain origin killer but fail address major point dahmer's development reason country intrigued story details stored bodies apartment lengths measures went to accomplish cannibalism desire flesh but sum up too many lagging points film focused sexuality not enough gore good stuff expect title "dahmer "
prior watching "dahmer " thought no worse than "freddy got fingered " wrong sum "dahmer" up it's story gay serial killer features almost no killing almost entirely consists dahmer's encounters gay men killed no plot serves no purpose as far as telling "dahmer " all you'll learn dahmer watching liked sex men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible choose watching "dahmer" projectile vomiting hours vomiting wll less painful 
i'm big fan true crime genre but couldn't sit putrid piece almost as dahmer intended as erotica porn flic soundtrack no look dahmer tick no exploration victims nothing but "look creepy guy " filmmakers much dahmer creepiest thing disgrace screen 
i really felt cheated seeing picture felt like sat watching 101 minutes nothing don't understand thinking hardly gets jeffrey dahmer murdering no ending felt almost like leaving open sequel like watching television episode sopranos ends suddenly know there's going episode week felt like just watched 1 many possibilities went wrong got lazy ran money didn't know rest story wanted make dahmer 2 seeing all sound very accurate watching jeffrey dahmer walking woods all sudden hear music playing writing comes screen says dahmer served 2 years sentence attacked fellow inmate killed age 34 wow goes walk woods death jail showing got showing dahmer's trial showing more can't explain happened jumped all place actually myself saying disbelief "that's that's end " want conclude review saying still good dahmer yet to filmmakers i'd like say you're going it right

this truly bad film character "cole" played michael moriarty biggest reason flopped actor felt conjuring up unbelievably awkward southern drawl make character more evil didn't 20 minutes wished speech therapist make appearance added sincerity 1 badly acted 2 unsympathetic characters 3 razor thin plot lineyuck 
the various nudity scenes reviewers referred poorly body double obviously used ms pacula reluctant scenes herself turned role offer not any worse than typical canadian as reviewers pointed canadian generally poorly written lack entertainment value most watchers hoping canadian producers consciously trying "de commercialize" but forgotten very important thing definition commercial thing 
saw tv late night yeah hear y'all say likely categorized as stereo typical tv soap series all fairness story line does fine twist nod saying "well that's not expected " but as film well not easy spot redeeming element casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no there's nothing congratulate rated r oh scene did need film watch forget watched title again 
this awesomely bad awesomely embarassing canadian grow good wine writers poets world's best national ballet rated top companies world but make bloody awful isn't especially bad it's especially typical typically bad shot bit hotels public parks thin direction high school level acting "gee whiz lets button camera does " photography michael moriarity intent doing jack nicholson impersonation couldn't least good jack nicholson impersonation shot vancouver truly loveliest cities earth centre yacht building "plot" god's let endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate disguised as seattle not mad film i'm embarassed more than little ashamed australians turn splendid stuff produce pretentious second rate piffle gawd

while overall idea escape atlantis intriguing film far less than hoped reading plot summery too much child technological age as 2002 official years ago viewing fantasy epics as lord rings science fiction feats like star wars as whole not compare similar line as dinotopia homer's odyssey beef basically couldn't relate just age children young adult no trouble putting myself place middle aged man character available but picture did not different mental plain existence didn't myself saying 'ack thing ' did not open doors imagination comparing high budget films tv standing certain aspects feature cliche character development children occurred too rapidly liking seeing too much stereotypical selfish teenager bitter divorce image changing we're big happy family let's never separate again feel ultimately make break picture long run characters undergone improvement typical set stereotypes present selfish beauty looking rebellious accompanied mr perfect image combining athletics good looks intelligence yet brooding attitude lastly smart aleck little brother common days while know personalities pushed story think adding more individuality as far as nuances more unique differences more enjoyable believable as far as character raise glass costume set design worth finishing end don't wrong all worth seeing opinion never account opinion many but think little more depth script little more cannot believe saying realness dare say escape atlantis magical

jack black usually make snicker simply breathing but direction writing lack plot constant mugging aided abetted constant straight camera shots 050 joke batting average still utter waste time idea sounds promising but potential gets wasted utter lack comedy worst direction i've seen tube kept hearing film portrayed mexicans very negatively while that's no doubt true really don't think meant racist think that's it's more result "creative" team desperately trying funny mess almost hear crying camera "hey look it's ugly mexican laugh people love all things tenacious laugh "but racism charges aside it's plunked good money time watch pile leftover refried beans offended imo

unless somebody enlightens really no idea looks like picture message but far tells pointless story new york press agent problems thats basically all agent played pacino think important but takes no hard thinking figure meaningless dull best actors world al pacino second year "simone" deserves title "the most boring most pointless motion picture year" whats going al

"people know" clunker no root no care despite game efforts talented cast pacino delivers usual tour force as eli wurman past prime publicity agent hollowed lifetime moral corruption but unlike michael corleone it's impossible emotional investment character dilemma fate film traces eli's preparations benefit liberal political cause while distracted client's ryan o'neal good underwritten latest "dirty laundry" case tv actress companion who's gotten involved wrong people tea leoni brings customary star power supporting role although again script doesn't much work as eli's sister law kim basinger manages evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics strictly like watching pacino strut stuff enjoy principals unfortunately script direction "people know" strictly amateurish limited theatrical release speedy journey dvd consider warned

the exploding zeppelins crashing 'sky captain' jude law's base present adequate metaphor truly terrible let state right bat sincerely doubt paramount recover any money film cult hit but remarkable failed achieve studio pitch "let's combine 1920's german expressionism 1940's globetrotting adventure modern action flick use animation dominate scene wow won't success " skycaptain bludgeons viewer sheer excess too many fake explosions too many unconvincing dogfight scenes too few real moments characters but painfully dimensional all shock awe floating airship or moreover groundbreaking film seamlessly combining generated imagery human actors stylized intriguing setting instead flop no small fails meet most important requirement any flick using cgi quite simply graphics amazingly poor movement cars physics aircraft dogfights just little i'm not nit picky any way infant notice car doesn't glide road like maglev train unless mercedes s500 raising voices protest crying 'this stylized film it's not supposed like reality' let just say lord rings set standard integrating real life actors cgi starship troopers set standard ironic science fiction films rocketeer did solid job reintroducing decade 1920's hollywood film portfolio tim burton's batman created unique picture new york city gotham yet repeated sky captain falls short all films hard mention sentence plus acting poor makes positively ill spent $9 film review hope dissuade all making mistake did 
this way hyped lot viewers thought "amazing" old school cause whole set past thought just showing past expecting faded dreamy like lighting characters pass but just going basically trying mix future past 2 don't mix very well special effects actually blue screen actors working too many exactly did no reason critics hype up saying "it's greatest done" it's just crap stick didn't help story line sooo crappy don't understand hollywood agreed produced don't understand actors actresses willing like it's almost as though everybody read script forgot read fine print "it all computer" network nothing revolutionary i'm very upset myself paying money don't waste time money today tomorrow 
a gave "2" instead "1" awful no denying many visuals stunning lot talent went special effects artwork but wasn't enough save "sepia" toned washed colors sort thing many times nothing new there hat tips old classic ok no problem but got entertaining interesting not sleep story line script awful characters dimensional slow moving scenes pretty look but ultimately as whole quite boring couldn't recommend 
the opening shot best thing gave hope seeing passionate well crafted independent film damn opening shot filling hope as "film" progressed slow plodding manner thoughts varied relation "film" too much butter popcorn did actors pay director "film" did ticket validated box office yes dear reader saw film theatre exception make seeing film home theatre home turn any redeeming values peter lemongelli as standard college "nerd" moments especially dog collar than "film" went trying comedy family drama spiritual uplifter succeeded none fronts oh girlfriend realllllllllly bad performance comedy 
i like time period like attempt but watching looks like i'm looking coke bottle gives headache played games blurry focus upgrade look director but not hurts eyes want leave 10 minutes hadn't taken film though series not say band brothers accomplished look like wwii footage just touch graininess but still pleasure watch need real people real sets real locations use cgi appropriate not entire film 
sky captain possibly best awful i've seen long while rife amazing cg special effects studded list cast jude law gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie infinitely likable giovanni ribisi racing overused but indiana jones esquire storyline great watch 'should have' key term course jude law plays joe sky captain dashing accent plenty shoulder heart melting smirks but can't make nothing flippant deliveries boyish good looks can't save movie's stone dialogue slapped giovanni ribisi said "good boy dex " just more time barfed all guy gwyneth paltrow as polly perkins nothing less than nerve grating nasal whining not quite sarcastic comments old minutes too much effort playing stereotypical 30's comic book heroine knows expected more example similar character played played well late 90's flick "the phantom " starring kristy swanson billy zane rent you'll know mean giovanni ribisi angelina jolie saving graces film angelina jolie incredibly hot eyepatch i'll admit just few short scenes actors managed rise tired material deliver more riveting performance than dry dimensional castmates plot steady story progression old boring basically just monotonous combination good scene action past thirty years pace rapid half snail's pace second giving audience enough time not guess eventual conclusion film but figure key villain as well pairing clichd polly perkins sky captain apparently reunite years separation bitterly ended romance story isn't much charming eclectic as annoying mismatched finally come terms mutual feelings end film nobody's surprised nobody really cares either props director appreciating bai ling enough dress skintight vinyl entirety film intriguing sepia tones served as coloration but sky captain despite having all essential elements great falls flat face not worth $2 75 paid theater 
"sky captain" considered homage comic books pulp adventures serials but contains little magic best genres contributor says enjoyment film depends not recognizes films influences don't think all true one's expectations films fiction serials "captain" pays tribute entirely different especially experienced entertainments children film almost completely devoid charm magnetic attraction course know leads scrapes but tension drama climax "captain" law paltrow minutes prevent catastrophe time minutes walking not running goal time long looks unnecessary conversation contemplation fallen foe 30 seconds left tragedy course expects certain conventions included but good director kept up sense urgency doesn't expect films like necessarily "make sense" does expect fun thrilling sense interior logic "captain" almost none remember law paltrow pursued winged creatures reach huge chasm cross log bridge well come perfectly safe creatures reach fly chasm itself means nothing bridge unnecessary escape land chasm 'forbidden' flying creatures film no effort let know know paltrow law given fine performances past playing "types" but pretty flat giovanni ribisi showed himself capable great nuance angelina jolie any "oomph" roles although omid djalili like handled little more he'd given chance did pretty good job considering basically wasted film great 'look' but many ways cgi distracts cgi works best used fantastical used create creatures don't exist nature scientific magical spectacular used substitute natural locations disappoints no real sense wonder cgi mountain doesn't any stateliness sense awe foreboding real mountain does know design film quite deliberate wasn't necessarily supposed look real but shouldn't feel way just didn't as weak clichd script homage no excuse thrills dramatic tension still enjoyable "the samurai" as predictable as days week no fan tom cruise but "captain" didn't most notably drew viewer world accept rules way way "sky captain" most definitely did not i'd like similar approach taken films comic book heroes 30's 40's original jay garrick flash green lantern alan scott come mind as ripe treatment maybe better more well known fully realized characters character make much better film hard worse 
visually interesting but falls flat originality department tedious excercise technique wears thin opening battle jude law charisma burnt toast but defense film contains worst dialogue seen big screen fact script poor keeps taking film thinking work bills dogs many moments scream bluescreen paltrow as wooden as saved snappy film noir dialogue top camp complaint technique black white film sorry helped looks like turner colorized black white just big dull clich mess break femur than sit endurance test again 
"sky captain world tomorrow" amazingly incovenient title simply bad no heart no deep ideas nothing very special yes cgi backgrounds look interesting but result whole thing shot annoying soft focus additionally uses music way as say "gilligan's island" scooby doo cartoons never stops terribly simply terrible no fresh ideas either just gobs gobs gobs bits taken older serials no gatekeeper just exist save money time not entertaining all 
in word film boring lacked life spark big problem leads jude law gwyneth paltrow no chemistry whatsoever boring annoying visuals interesting but didn't enhance scenes visuals tended detach audience happening screen none action sequences felt real film failed create any real drama sense danger film potential but needed better script better acting better director kept thinking film know would've worked harrison ford sky captain karen allen polly steven spielberg director ignore critical acclaims film critics think praising film want like want succeed though fails many different levels 
what waste time i've tried sit 'sky captain " 6 times time 3 minutes start doing else it's downright boring acting terrible writing dull obviously time director it's stiff wanted love love sci fi old cliffhangers appreciate attempt nods flash gordon metropolis but god waste money used work paramount pictures written sherry lansing 1993 using blue screen screen tests told they'd never interest need 10 years later paramount releases piece crap sherry right 1993 but forgotten advice greenlighted dog blue screen effect shot but not entire let's not forget neither jude nor jolie terrific actors but easy eyes paltrow's performance reminds high school effort too bad could've worked but under skilled director funny thing sky captain's director getting work dreck it's commerce not art 
this feels scene the maximum number actors screen like 10 shot blue screen never really any extras just feels weird acting horrible it's obvious blue screen all action scenes actor actress wondering half running running lives looking floor marks spoilers you'll banging head watching point sky captain's home base like 100 planes sitting airstrip advanced warning attack coming nothing all planes blown up yet again person fighting sky captain entire world under attack he's person fighting very end hundreds plains taking finally but nothing

i shall not waste time writing much further aspect film indescribably bad great many times 'plot' started as very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster numbers bore very quickly descended utter shambles anybody pretends hidden masterpiece inside awful mess just kidding 7 8 years watched 1 week run cinema pulled yet sticks mind easily most terrible film seen making comments reason went film amusing fact brother eddie appeared as second 'heavy' pub scene hands thrust zippo lighter rhys ifan's face bar 'russia' actually filmed butlins holiday camp barry island brother absolutely no acting experience whatsoever recently joined extras' agency having seen film appeared nobody required any acting experience whatsoever remember 8 people whole cinema just couple days released never heard film unpopular disappeared fast rightly case thinking renting film dvd advise instead pound coins red hot jam eye sockets probably lot less painful than watching film 
there no doubt film impressive cast but unfortunately doesn't help major downsides never understand directors ask actors actresses use accents not obvious can't convince fiennes just can't irish fitzgerald isn't much better russian voice wrong no matter good acting character never convincing as the major problem plot guess sort storyline involved but full holes just couldn't wait film end ridiculous save 90 minutes life don't watch

i liked film action scenes very interesting tense well especially liked opening scene semi truck very tense action scene well transitional scenes filmed interesting ways as time lapse photography unusual colors interesting angles film funny parts liked evil guy portrayed too i'd film 8 10 
i enjoyed night listener very much it's better summer robin williams gives best performances fact entire cast very good all played just right notes characters not too much not too little sandra oh adds wonderful comic touch toni collette great as mom never goes top very believable it's short just under hour half noticed general release version minutes shorter than sundance version wonder more disturbing images cut the director told story did straightforward fashion refreshing change many directors days think job impress audience than tell story tell well not sucker punched previews ads not hitchcockian thriller night listener want good story told well expecting hitchcock disappointed complaint ending director left little more audience's imagination but minor quibble 
the night listener probably not william's best roles but makes very interesting character somewhat odd but very different guarantee you never seen kind people maybe won't like slow pacing but think it's great plus definitely top come year 2006 intriguing performance great content dramatic feeling no americanized neither predictable just feel that secrets hard time determine outcome no excellent but hell it's damn good very original 
the night listener held attention robin williams shining as new york city radio host enamored friendship 14 year old boy rory culkin very ill williams never met boy person as contact talking telephone however williams' ex boyfriend nice job bobby cannavale raises doubt boy prompts williams arrange meeting person follows makes permanent impact williams way does not expect leave toni collette stars enjoyed film toni collette giving memorable portrayal culkin's adoptive mother sandra oh starred as williams' friend night listener inspired actual events somber almost creepy silence times predictable no thanks reviews read seeing just logic but liked enjoy williams roles like more than comedic characters added bonus recommended 8 10
popular radio storyteller gabriel no robin williams scraggy speaking hushed hypnotic tones acquainted friends fourteen year old boy wisconsin named pete logand rory culkin written book detailing sexual abuse parents boot pete aids compels gabriel further still partner jess bobby cannavale good happens survivor hiv himself acquaints himself pete's guardian woman named donna toni collette brilliant gabriel decides wants meet talk person goes wisconsin discovers secrets naturally not prepared based real events happened armistead maupin wrote screenplay terry anderson directed patrick stetner film moves lot faster 90 min maybe few minutes longer than think genre run that's good keeps action storyline lean clear it's bad leaves various holes plot doesn't sew up any plot openings story i'd not any great except say not familiar mr maupin's works personal story feel little bit loop still performances williams would've loved heard more narration personally collette cannavale culkin much supporting cast waitress restaurant collete's donna frequents does great job small top notch mood established chilly lonely dark exteriors wisconsin new york terrific framing story ends don't tie particularly well but it's still compelling enough story stick 
if thing recommend film intriguing premise certainly draws audience mystery film hints dark lurking however not much tension williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't much makes relate obsession boy collete fares much better as woman true nature intentions not very clear production felt rushed holes apparent certainly feels like preview much more complete better effort book probably better thing certain taupin written truly good inspired least commendable effort 
i absolutely loved film not all relate all comments read completely enthralled second story gripping acting intense direction spot literally jump time phone ring close end though nothing "scary" story itself soundly edge whole rest evening many perfect choices casting script little bits humor sprinkled many points film could've gone cheap thrill but never did many mediocre thrillers come lately number years 
this night listener better than people generally saying weaknesses having genre identity crisis no doubt but think creepy atmosphere intriguing performances make up whole thing feels like fireside "this happened friend friend mine" ghost stories big complaint the pacing but slow awkward pacing deliberate unfolds kept well realm possibility real life just sort plods alongno no flashy endings earth shattering revelations no "showdown" scenes thank heaven zone watching forget reservations expectations makes conventionally good williams isn't terrific but easily meets needs story plus character supposed somewhat generic "no one" as everyman avatar enter story toni collette's performance nominated oscar maybe shouldn't win it shot quality content night listener surely top percent coming days 
when comes pretty picky i'll complain wrong while flaws night listener exceptionally low count read review hard half written caps contained no actual information led believe not too well unfortunately read more than 3 lines review discovered poster's reason disdain does not like fact director gay production team smokes crack apparently despite fact never written review thought deserved based merits not sexual orientation director let's quick checklist 1 great plot absolutely won't shred away but plot highly compelling definitely not expect based commercials thriller not horror approached as story really amaze more it's true plot did stay quite faithful actual events 2 wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free chains comedy type cast flourished serious roles many people wrote just decade ago again achieves high form role night listener playing radio host increasingly troubled entangled case well i'll let 3 excellent direction certainly unlike poster referred actually know direction i've sutdying art direction school 3 years course really don't think makes lick difference thing matters like direction but thought simply establish again i'm basing opinions substantial relevant example not sexual orientation director alleged drug habits production team lol patrick stettner's direction moody dark allowed angles lighting help create sought feelings "tension release" than messy fast paced camera work quick cuts we're often subjected today people truly story camera while other's feel as make story camera really appreciate days courage just use camera as supposed utilized as eyeball all 4 lighting cinematography editing great all i've wrote much things paragraphs i'll just wrap up short don't listen people alterior motives trashing especially they're stupid unknowingly reveal motive 1 4 way post enjoy ben

i few problems film heard lot criticisms saying overlong overrated true hours long but amazed goes quickly don't think overrated all think imdb rating perfectly decent film looks sumptuous gorgeous costumes excellent effects direction james cameron rarely slips focus leonardo dicaprio gives best performances as jack kate winslet lovely as rose david warner great actor steals scene he's story very rich hot character development obvious love story very moving needs though bit little slow hour extremely riveting confess edge seat titanic sank say minutes very moving music score james horner lovely though never huge fan song heart 1996 miniseries good but suffered undeveloped scenarios historical inaccuracies overall titanic 8 5 10 bethany cox 
i think james cameron favorite director second review remembers rms titanic big fast "unsinkable" april 1912 all news biggest tragedies well james cameron decided make but star fictional characters spotlight instead ship well main review but let remind all opinion zero fact fact present event film main characters jack leonardo dicaprio rose kate winslet they're not annoying too much but watch you'll annoying http tinyurl com ojhoyn main villain guess bad luck fate hand god no blasphemy intended just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all oh yes love story sinking boat supporting characters following personal favorite mr andrews victor garber idk nice lovejoy david warner murdoch ewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smith bernard hill molly brown kathy bates many more got present day treasure hunter brock lovett paxton add story good action awesome especially second half drama as good end eyes dropping rainstorms silent tears story simple works treasure hunter seeks heart ocean instead finds drawing woman wearing said diamond calls tells tale rms titanic lovers separated social class ultimately fate ship story works very few flaws titanic 86% awesome
titanic long but well tragic adventure love story takes place ill fated voyage unsinkable ship writer director james cameron great job making fictional love story very different people combining real event titanic sunk hitting iceberg april 15 1912 claiming thousands lives perished icy freeing waters north atlantic leads film great roles including leonardo dicaprio kate winslet make good screen couple dicpario winslet genuine chemistry romance eventually blossoms much more believable showed real talent came continued just most recently films as well rest supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde paxton small role equally impressive as characters help bring life film love story action suspense special effects magnificent especially time horror situation characters felt real really happened making want most survive life death situation pacing little slow times little long but rest up it's few flaws titanic makes great date sure make girls almost time watch fact really happened definitely added making feel sorry all lives lost titanic sunk atlantic hitting iceberg overall titanic tragic heartbreaking story people fall love while ill fated ship thats brought life exceptional performances cast especially dicaprio winslet definitely make worth time watch 
the ship sunk but didn't director james cameron 'the terminator' did again amazing picture favorite scenes 'the dinner table' scene rose's family friends meet jack saves rose look face woman meet 'the one' hope look room future husband jack rose connection 'movie stuff' but it's good stuff greedy mom all elite stuck up associates live husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but gilbert grape star rescues really liked hanging boat scene good risk long but it's fantastic good story good flow good actors twice want worth 
titanic all time favorite problems don't but still it's enjoyable stumble asks like titanic suppose reaction "wait minute don't " know many people don't like i'm not saying don't "the love story too cheesy" well yes but isn't enjoyable moving all right love story jack rose very unrealistic knows love like doesn't actually exist but doesn't enjoy watching beautiful story lets slip slightly fantasy while complaint dicaprio winslet terrible actors well ok agree not perform full potentials however think it's unfair say terrible actors personally think very talented actors unfortunately very famous not amazing but roles given simple characters real enough care quite bit but agree many people did not as well as expected finally going complain don't like hate romance hate history tragic i'm sorry but earth did clearly all things it's like people complain dark knight bad hate action simply not dislike genre good well deserving oscars particular best cinematography best i've seen save maybe lord rings trilogy know writing fails as constant screaming other's names the flashback portion story quite weak times but overall it's amazing achievement making titanic look real sinking feel epic understand lot people dislike but most boils disliking fundamental idea as love story than thinking itself poorly constructed tell read more than books titanic including memoirs form day happened extremely historically accurate save just few faults main ones piping threaded copper not steel iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as scene hit 10 10 not like romance but simply it's outstanding cinematic achievement leaves feeling horrified realistic adaptation events 
titanic classic really surprised didn't solid overall imdb user rankings maybe it's just cool not titanic credit nowadays but was really came people flocked theaters came video sister watch twice day month safe say obsessed good reason disaster scenes hard forgot like frozen baby guy committed suicide killing unruly crowd many people died ship convey film immediacy emotion needed hard challenge james cameron stepped up let's not forget amazing romance jack rose not relationship figment someone's imagination lovely barely knew but die trusted sure as hell giving romeo juliet run money "i'll never let jack " titanic great film it's very core powerful story told brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music crew full hard dedicated workers really blows mind says hate 
another aussie masterpiece delves world unknown supernatural does very well doesn't resort big special effects overkill like american flicks focuses more emotional impact relatively simple plot rebecca gibney bring life follows story couple buy old house supposedly home very old woman never went outside husband disappeared mysterious circumstances century ago strange things begin happen house john adam begins turn man disappeared actually mass murderer highly recommended 8 10
for personally film goes top all time no exceptions james cameron proved himself time time again master storyteller films as aliens abyss terminators clear brilliant confidant director as far as action science fiction goes sees story adds strange quality film but titanic much different strokes brilliance film exceptionally moving allows room surprises plot development interesting character developments story knows story famed voyager sinking maiden voyage legend challenge cameron make truthful interesting entertaining film acting wonderful as leonardo dicaprio plays jack kate winslet plays rose superstars overnight release film most films annoyed supporting characters aren't given lot but film more purposeful as elderly rose gloria stuart tells story quickly apparent rose's jack's story no emotionally entirely satisfying leave no dry eye theater home music iconic legendary composer james horner's finest soundtrack evokes much film audience song long annoying but still appreciate phenomenon film problem usual james cameron problem dialogue memorable but bad way as cheesy points but all aside james cameron delivered masterpiece romantic epic sweeps away journey lifetime heart won't

fact stargate sg 1 cheesy sci fi tv series there's no escaping facts much try excuse explain stargate sg 1 remains cheesy sci fi tv series stargate sg 1 does borrow steal ideas briskly special fx aren't nearly as impressive as action isn't going blow chair couch matter either but really think stargate sg 1 deserves all credit episode stolen idea think count least cheesy sci fi that's actually worse than hour tv episode fact episodes actually probably 90 minutes long still better than most able quality delivering pushing storyline further makes stargate sg 1 special very picky selections follow tv series most hold pretty high standards more surprised myself caught decide brush stargate sg 1 as yet tacky sci fi don't stick you'll i'm talking

shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars unlikely distribution west outside film festivals censors stomach film policemen anally rape male female suspects to talk victims enjoy old lady eye torn skull just few shocks store viewers ultraviolent cops gangsters story makes clockwork orange banned years uk look like disney cartoon film yes fantastic essential viewing fans asian cinema shocking moments illustrate goers world characters like make sure catch dead alive very similar barring insane ending doa course great japan talent like miike working time as takeshi kitano best chance seeing film outside takashi miike retrospective film festival dvd haven't try hunting hong kong version web as i'm sure come country 
shinjuku triad society albeit perfect fiercely compelling film tries depict uber conventional realm it's yakuza triad picture involving cops versus japanese chinese gangsters mostly chinese as title suggests but technical 'debut' takashi miike establishing many aspects films make social issues like black market trading precious goods case human organs usually children nostalgia childhood one's roots especially prevalent dead alive 2 thumbing nose taboos like gay sex satirical rape violence women blood curdling violence it's certainly not as surreal as miike's most recent films but expected as he's trying things he's just starting learn following track record straight video programmers it's got all qualities it's like films follow equally savage heartfelt crazy spots sardonic drama solid genre fans story concerns brothers chinese orphan raised japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as eastwood esquire anti hero hero who's detective who's gangster main arch likely takeover gang comes wang definite pun gang represents spare time played tomorowo taguchi as typical wacko real terror eyes partner karino takeshi caesar who's threatening just repeating commandment over woman who's just eye plugged following sour deal ruthless kind pop up almost organically miike there's intrigue involving organ trading scheme gangsters kiriya almost victim gang's penchant gay sex least little puppet sorts does main gangsters want all leads up vengeance redemption qualities miike writer trying emulate shakespeare macbeth bit wang washing bloody hangs over gay sex saying "it won't come off" doesn't add up emotional level impact great shakespeare play it's par course film like miike's goals met though just met low scale ambitions gangster picture added levels harsh familial trouble main tension brothers comes profession duty parents notes crueler aspects underworld crime realm unrepentant sex sexes brings psychologically characters time shinjuku triad society contains more than few moments classic biting black comedy miike oeuvre just taken grain salt director does outrageousness like bit beginning chair smashing face randomness "interrogation" as goes very twisted area there's laugh loud line young sex slave finishing act bosses "thank mr weeny burger " miike writer don't enough make film full dark comedy like ichi course visitor q but there's enough bring appropriate levity darker aspects story characters as entry "black society" trilogy as it's called quite impressed it's fine quasi calling card craziest new artists contemporary cinema 
this miikes triad society trilogy trilogy kicks great start the trilogy connected thematically themes actually apparent all films look close enough shinjuku triad society cop trying prevent kid brother getting too involved extreme gang outsiders struggling way top tokyos yakuza kid brother lawyer triad gang increasingly need as progresses takes place very harsh environment therefore pretty violent tough miike worse but serious hits very hard as usual lot perverted sex mostly homosexual many ways typical gangster but great drive true grittiness you've seen miikes far ichi killer fudoh worth checking sort compromise aggressive top style displayed more serious as seen films trilogy as always miike least scenes you'll never forget figure ones 8 10

i took flyer renting but gotta say very very good all fronts script cast director photography high production values proves eva longoria parker head shoulders rom com bad actors as kate hudson jennifer aniston mug acting who'da thunk parker isla fisher class regard try hold projects as good as "over dead body " lake bell excellent too time seen finally paul rudd gets shine really good instead lesser films like never gets dues close minded males it's too bad as imdb reviewers noted nothing lame gem no hack writing acting depiction contemporary l california general makes scene look bright beautiful clean outstanding way never l look good ah little talent lot caring won't divulge plot but as long time hard core atheist willing suspend disbelief buy supernatural theme order enjoy excellent light hearted piece entertainment reminds very much old "topper" enjoyable exposes popular but hackneyed like "ghost" mediocre overly sentimental crap fests know public taste leans heavily mediocre save praise truly worthy however enjoyed overlooked gems as "into night" michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum clu gulager "blind date" bruce willis kim basinger "american dreamer" jobeth williams "chances are" robert downey jr christopher mcdonald cybil sheppard "making mr right" john malkovich you'll enjoy rate job all it's kinda hard believe straight guy pretend gay more than years but plot device doesn't detract movie's overall excellence 
ah loved think it all laugh loud dozen times yes girl i'm writing girl's perspective think it's shame scored 5 2 rating too many guys voting far romantic comedies just i'm female don't enjoy all chic flicks contrary prefer genres romantic comedies tend shallow not as funny as meant but like said all almost opinion great script good liners fine acting although eva longoria parker's character reminded very much gabrielle desperate housewives but awesome film rainy days days feel low need few laughs 
this good story nice pace all characters developed cool i've watched whole bunch weeks best i've seen weeks jason bigg's character best though though small cleverly crafted very beginning romantic comedy don't like most but writing direction performing sound design overall all capacity just really thought pretty cool film scored pretty high all movie's i've seen lately rest big budget better publicized good job writing 
look it's eva longoria paul rudd dead girlfriend haunting new girlfriend it's gabrielle desperate housewives guy wore "sex panther cologne" anchorman expecting golden globe nominated need rethink look however willing suspend reality 90 minutes want watch funny you've come right place characters all funny work very well real match up paul rudd lake bell he's as funny as friends funny good looking all time went wife enjoyed did 
i given terrific series full 10 vote claudia black not continued inclusion as silly 'vela' brought series estimation bring as regular time as including ben browder replace rda mistake unfortunately just reeling loss 'jack' really didn't need great series turned new episodes 'farscape' great fan film "stargate" series announced reservations live up film but watching episode admit hooked always looked forward new episodes great anticipation
in complete contrast opinions review film actually surprisingly good reluctantly went expected bored clichs obvious jokes overacting all trailer promised however 5 minutes myself genuinely laughing enjoying refreshing acting 'toilet humour' gag dead body manages actually come up realistically funny scenarios spoiling too much moments involving animals hilarious staple ingredients good film all script director actors compared recent attempts romantic comedy film stands tall sure aren't going learn spiritual awakening but open mind more than likely good time

imdb lists as 1972 reason but sources i've seen including excellent program notes mark as '68 doesn't really matter except it's quite interesting watch abstract collage film video art works merge apparently context star gate sequence 2001 released year pure abstraction isn't really thing but small doses super saturated optically printed colors psychedelic feel series flowers rohrschach blots birds pretty compelling quite beautiful certainly helped paved way many nascent video artists 70s deserves better known 
all hear poorly animation not up par expects but look way expect perfection hell belief animation dry gritty purpose great character transformation considering probably as close live action as hope sequel very soon want live action think better chastity purgatori don't think lady death transfer well film but as personal belief all naysayers dead wrong no pun intended 
it's very good not fans lady death comics but like animated series adventure fantasy film innocent girl killed hadn't but daughter ruler hell lucifer himself seeks revenge rest better liked lot characters like original comics form chaos never chance read the parts story comics ones passages cannot tell events exactly like comics but way it's story lady death 
i personally liked alarmed rating's people given it based comic book animated don't like comic books animation course won't like did watch bother rate though fan interesting strong characters heroic sexy women kicking butt saving world hell love thought story really pulled very cool quite anime esque more like american following new trend adult animation like titan e meet's live action version punisher end highly recommend comic buff super hero fan open enough mind looking fun 
i love the comics comics different but still i'd 10 10 awesome got anymore awesome babies female read comics won't regret yes brian p artist died don't nearly as good artistic work mean seriously don't wrong people did great but different versions different people different strokes different folks as saying goes any guy doesn't bonkers insane does not like women know just plan insane count fingers love many times read comics run fingers sure but hey always toes 
although not best anime seen but enjoyed lady death never read comic book just saw video store decided chance animation ok got sense 80's anime set hates character development fine like brought transition hope lady death don't like obviously wasn't paying attention lucifer tells happens used words creamtor nice mentor soldier dark bruiting style perfect kind think bashed needs look reconsider cause people bashed said everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d

"stargate sg 1" follows intergalactic explorations team named sg 1 device called stargate all surprises awaiting the wormhole having seen series sporadically it's few seasons came didn't know good series really 10 years seen episode old impression series great but impression far truth "stargate sg 1" more than just simple sci fi series most well interesting long running exciting sci fi produced runs amazing premise series value far surpasses based think very good example television as medium suitable premise able provide doesn't work time restriction film sense familiarity created long running series watching characters circumstances progressing time stunning just adds ability suspend disbelief it's all result terrific writing lot dedication all crew "stargate sg 1" kept offering great adventures 10 years but never afraid challenge moving plot gave way very different time periods the few seasons up 4th 5th focused lot more exploration planets different situations keeping episodes fairly unrelated not always impending goaul'd threat 5th 7th increasingly more episodes focusing fighting goaul'd preventing attacks earth seasons exploration planets almost excuse putting sg 1 place goaul'd replicator ori conflicts 8th season probably most mixed stream episodes includes minor earth matters stargate hardly mentioned but episodes feature great replicator moments 9th 10th travel new enemy no jack o'neil good continuations although few episodes 10th season little weak little more than sg 1 human jaffa losing battle battle ori basically season 7 exploration pushed background many ways shame potential mystery planet episode presented hand many great episodes ongoing conflicts change nature still worked shows great bold writers tough believe series high quality ending nicely puts rest feeling people involved all great professionals series narrative plenty offer season returning beginning nature series very doable most welcome but ultimately things as end fact enjoyed it's little hard ends big picture however drawn work hundreds people course 10 years sight beauty true testament dedication crew outstanding actors characters always remember as collective sg 1

this whimsical film misfortune released time highly popular "amelie" having wonderful audrey tautou playing central role laurent firode talented director most enjoyable films come france recent memory film deals chance as english title indicates french title makes reference butterflies wings create chaos atlantic as fly as well as hurricanes pacific not believed just looking colorful insects start director interlaces all characters sees film connection hard imagine but film's context work well chance meeting metro sets tone film irene going work asked woman sitting opposite tell zodiac sign proceeds read paper irene cross paths soul mate day irene leaves train quiet young man seated woman tells birth date as irene destined start but alas not reconnect frame film audrey tautou wonderful as irene faudel plays younes doesn't lot end but shows presence plays well talented young cast makes valuable contribution success film as light as butterfly wings look forward future films laurent firode appears director heart right place ear way humans connected 
to review contain spoilers but like watching no idea going happen therefore think many reviews contain spoilers just watched again reiterate best ending any ever real translation 'the beating butterfly's wings' oddly not used as translated title suppose thought most americans wouldn't know chaos theory except saw read "jurassic park" based chaos theory small event affect outcome seemingly unrelated events all lead event whirlwind wondrous cause effect as follow chain chaos as intertwines characters 20 way ending inevitable despite but think it perfect ending think "what needed said" time very brave ending too bad overseas gem like but ending like never come hollywood 
most people chase featuring audrey tautou not understand amelie character not really audrey tautou's real life personality partakes not going amelie 2 3 said too picked up simply audrey yes it's true big gap scene isn't seen all maybe 45 min but didn't miss having much fun characters guy lies too funny guy justifies people run cafe skip finding coupons balance loss actually getting all characters quite while but best i've seen while audrey tautou's character irene not overdone sugary girl amelie fact as irene rudeness bum asking change caught guard film irene girl good intentions but course very awful day disposition more more sour pessimistic makes film completely great all really interesting stories plots building very entertaining watch great scenery shots very colorful never too slow all characters actually act best comes 20 minutes left all plots start mesh ride really picks up ties makes sense whole butterfly effect blossoms swear best 20 minutes film i've seen quite while ending think "damn really lucked finding movie" ending top notch wrote script brilliant not all subplots going but make all tie sensible manner case but make character feel human come alive not just stale persona used as crutch build up whole butterfly effect very impressive highly suggest as it's great film watch anytime any mood any company 
the mystery delightful small comedy ignored most critics failed audience deserves simply showcasing budding talent audrey tautou enough generate greater recognition cognoscenti lacking pretension relying quirky characterizations rumination interconnection human behavior manages amusing life affirming unlike more critically acclaimed competition genre as taste actually entertains 
the fluttering butterfly wings atlantic unleash hurricane pacific according theory related chaos theory i'm not sure exactly action no matter small insignificant start chain reaction lead big events small jewel film shows series seemingly unrelated characters most paris actions affect others' lives degrees separation theory applied as well story facet jewel film acting finely tuned nuanced audrey tautou luminous stories mesh plausibly humor just right viewer leaves theatre nodding agreement

having seen most ringo lam's films say best film date most unusual it's ancient china period piece cranked full kick ass martial arts location underground lair full traps dungeons plays as big as any characters action fantastic story tense entertaining set design truely memorable sadly burning paradise not available dvd vhs impossible mitts near second biggest china town north america like don't pass up 
"burning paradise" combination neo shaw brothers action ringo lam's urban cynicism watches film feel fight scenes mediocre nature but doesn't matter it's attitude atmosphere counts great film always trying different than contemporaries lam gives traditional heroes fong sai yuk hung shi kwan puts "raiders lost ark" setting however not light hearted comedic incarnations jet li instead guys fight death brutal results makes film better die anytime no holding too bad don't make films like more often 
an unusual film ringo lam that's strangely under appreciated mix fantasy kung fu more realistic depiction swords spears driven bodies startling especially minutes horseback rider chopped waist legs riding horse horses chopped up it's very unexpected story very simple fong shaolin brothers captured crazed maniac general imprisoned red lotus temple more torture chamber temple general similarity kurtz apocalypse as spouts warped philosophy makes frightening paintings human blood production very impressive setting bleak blood action very well mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes time veers absurdity effects cheesy but it's never bad enough ruin film it's best hk kung fu films early nineties just remember it's not child friendly 
hello dave burning paradise film likes jackie chan indiana jones films main protagonist most definitely bastard son strange fathers as characters well familiar transformations similar action film stereotypes film original blending traditional hong kong style hollywood action adventure sadly not true films hollywood 
this finest films come hong kong's 'new wave' began tsui hark's "zu warriors magic mountain" tsui set tone new wave's approach martial arts film pretty much all directors new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung accepted as given approach films thenceforth need more than touch irony not outright comedy "burning paradise" stop all vengeance it's not isn't humor but purely human humor as aged buddhist priest beginning manages quick feel nubile young prostitute while hiding bundle straw but just as humans not buddhist priests saints all time irony introduced film nastiest possible emanating 'abbot' red lotus temple study pure nihilism as never recorded film very incarnation milton's satan "paradise lost" "better rule hell than serve heaven " can't satan's hell soon enough he'll turn world living hell rule that's motif underscoring brutal violence much imagery it's not abbot just wants kill people wants despair feel utterly hopeless accept nihilism as all encompassing reality thus there's definite sense pervading red temple scenes just not any reality outside temple itself all universe abbot claiming mastery infinite power charge course fortunately film doesn't end though losses human just ordinarily human prevails want know film yet no doubt viewing film visit hell hopefully not witness afterlives but certainly feel chastened experience better all 
people expect no less than brilliant steven spielberg directs no exception love did poorly box office but i'm glad say isn't million dollars don't think bad characters fun animation clear not fuzzy music modern too unusual animated didn't think professor screw eyes "scary cirus" too scary little kids targeted audience but thought happened creepy professor end little too dark kids' overall fun enchanting classic loved dearly years 
i disagree done't like used love little still it's sweet funny warms heart proves love friendship never destroyed though didn't much story still excellent 10 thumbs up oh yeah proves deepest wish's dreams come true tear tear love personally says sucked than say "shame " delightful little i'm glad least people liked 
this escape reality past years sadly miss although atlantis filled hole small bit episode sg1 television beautifully robert wrote felt close reality as though trying explain like set working closely long time bound up's downs but years they've turned family thought wonderful way end despite else's criticisms sg1 special time time again took thresholds disbelief amazement wonderful characters stories directors writers episode hooked blend action science drama especially comedy worked well wanting more no real words completely express meant thank kept fresh entertaining many years inspired many things thought impossible look forward year really hope number never want die stargate sg1 1997 2007

guinea pig devil's experiment doubt stars view raw realistic creepy disturbing look dark human nature gets right point thinking point point satisfy fan's just extreme violence gore gore more less just torturing women violently really 3 scene's considered gore i'll tell thing though guinea pig devil's experiment makes hostile look like sesame street thought hostile crazy brutal disturbing torture flick ain't seen half you've seen guinea pig devil's experiment rating 0 5 gore 0 10guinea pig devil's experiment uncut 7 
i surprised than many viewers hold more respect sequel brilliant seen all guinea pigs easily best though ive seen "making of" still doubts watching 35mins pure torture powerful 10 10 achieved perfectly set best fake snuff film 
after having watched "guinea pig" questions come mind 'am really psychopath watch ' 'is snuff ' answer no although it's closest thing snuff i've seen 'where hell girl ' gets tortured '45 min any reasons given fact nothing fingernails teared beaten hands feet tools infested maggots many more final scene i'm still not sure did belongs 'japonese underground scene' it's obvious didn't lot money motivations saw japonese subtitles but it's not problem no real dialogues boys just insulting few scenes haven't seen yet all serial but "guinea pig" not known best still i've rated 8 purpose making people believe snuff issue quite good ask charlie sheen actor but think gone further did following ones i'm hiding parents 8 10
this no story it's bunch guys tortures innocent young girl death spoilers they beat net let hang inside like birdfood spin chair pukes expose loud noise pour boiling oil worms sores crush hand sledge hammer finally pokes needle eye realistic didn't know fake thought snuff although disgusted really liked it scared guess fills kind purpose 10 10 
i seen short few years ago watch all sequels really not best but it's most popular i've watch making guinea pig 1 it's really great guys did sequels excellent special effects chance watch 
this the infamous guinea pig best time looks realistic unrealistic just knowing fake story woman got captured tortured lot different ways man beginning story receives letter return address includes manga video showing torture men capture testing limits human die scenes shocking as eyeball scene not shocking like girl punched 100 times punches nearly lot gore recommend people 17 older 9 10
the installment notorious horror series presented as snuff film discovered producers set up like amateur camcorder tape complete digital timer the frame presents woman kidnapped gang black clad men torture days finally killing hapless victim beaten savagely pelted raw meat having fingernails pulled pliers hand smashed hammer eye punctured needle forth most nauseating scene woman's captors burn hot water drop live maggots burns series received great deal publicity american actor charlie sheen believing series contain actual murder attempted ban distribution united states fbi investigation revealed films appeared to most viewers sick creations using nasty but obvious special effects gruesomely staged acclaimed japanese comic book artist hideshi hino directed fourth episodes film sure way clear all but most tolerant rooms but gorehounds probably won't special 
what say film hasnt said well tell truth alot looks very fake like slaps kicks charlie sheen though real dont know im sure hitting kicking alot harder however scenes pinching hot oil look very real final needle eye scene amazingly probibly thing film shocked 
wow alot reviews devils experiment wonderful steve run unearthed films just started releasing guinea pig films dvd north america ask writing review instead ask people bash i'm writing review love guinea pig films love em it's throat don't let i've seen all almost horror film known man argento fulci bava buttgereit underground cult sensation hollywood blockbuster i've seen all films stuck head years definitely guinea pig films doesn't try hide reason watch horror 1st place review devils experiment devoid story fine watch horror films blood gore torture people devils experiment not delivers but that's all pure unadulterated violence yeah like story but just want gore devils experiment delivers fold people bash cause like story torture death person hidden story make em feel better all want blood gore it's just really hard justify it's not wrapped story guinea pig films historical meaning created definitive splash released i'm thrilled able release most famous horror series world maybe shouldn't written review but again maybe view biased cause releasing but again it's not i've always told people to watch way started unearthed films sure it's exploitive top but isn't watch horror films 1st place devils experiment not everybody it's thrill seekers gorehounds think jason freddy krueger awesome stick but level seen all devils experiment reason haven't released 17 years wrong disgusting right freaky not watch mom unless totally cool good luck enjoy never stop living life 
a lot people unfairly sh t series but guinea pig videos fairly entertaining devil's experiment particular really fantastic effects work not just infamous eyeball scene but very realistic skin slice foot hand breaking sledgehammer very realistic especially video's vintage low budget let start beginning don't know film "extreme" torture fake snuff film surfaced japan mid 80s it's plot as stands simple young girl held few men forced undergo series brutal tortures breaking point entails brutal violence all effectively realistic effects including ones mentioned paragraph as well as painful looking application hot oil captive girl's arm placing maggots subsequent flaky wound least effective sequences very beginning video consist unconvincing slap session men turns slapping hell girl as head falls second sequence men turns kicking girl pushing ground scenes obviously staged detract realism rest proceedings actress plays victim "experiment" pretty convincing pain takes good abuse rough stuff camera reactions as headphones strapped head loud noises played hours end chilling abuse takes strung up net tree times given rest disturbing scene giggling captors guts disgustingly sleazy scene spun office chair forced drink bottle jack daniels till pukes haven't seen series hope helped decide not want episode shot 8 5 10 devil's experiment 
my rating refers 4 seasons stargate sg 1 wonderfully fresh creative addicting cast stepped gate never knew lay starting season 5 took different focus still good but different series follows adventures team humans alien regularly venture planetary transport device called "stargate" backstory series based characters events "stargate" device discovered archaeological dig egypt episodes light innocent easy watch very creative many inventive stories easily great sci fi happens always unpredictable characters rests well defined brilliantly performed tone serious but dialog flowered incredible wit humor simply fun watch starting season 5 series started evolve continuing storyline based fighting single foe goa'uld ori plots more complex lot more political strategic oriented interdependent characters still as great as but different nature thing mentioned watch episodes commemorated 100th 200th episodes simply can't miss shows exhibit creative wildly humorous genius carried series 10 seasons sci fi fan watch few episodes 4 seasons you'll likely hooked like evolving story lines opposing sides 10 seasons shows look forward 
the installment notorious horror series presents woman kidnapped gang black clad men torture days finally killing beaten savagely spun chair endlessly finger nails pulled animal guts thrown hot boiling water poured finally eyeball punctured needle really sick nasty scene makers unforgettable torture tried make as real as possible closest thing snuff film committing murder tape course special effects poor but idea making snuff pretty gruesome seen "flowers flesh blood" more gory sadistic but less disturbing horror fans 
first not supposed brilliant thought provoking film like many reviewers compare review says lines likes knows nothing horror cinema apparently way look film really wasn't meant convincing low budget ipecac but really thats all aiming meant blow viewers away sheer shock value all flaws visuals much less noticeable original vhs versions gave high score reached goal though not downright horrific non shock sense did make slightly sick thoroughly paranoid pessimistic didn't trust week didn't want wake up strung up tortured 
just ultimate masterpiece opinion line phrase picture exactly place lindsay crouse joe mantegna just cool shrink sleazy man well cast 10 10 
"house games" flawlessly constructed film few films seen gaping screen astonishment cleverly unexpectedly ends saw video few years reading roger ebert's review proclaimed best film 1987 doubts mainly not quite as well known as films year boy surprise smartest most well written seen screenplay quite piece work not terms plot twists turns pulls rug under just think all figured but terms character development second viewing began realize mamet's screenplay succeeds not as clever suspense film but plot development contributes understanding characters motivations climax particularly effective absolutely inevitable stems naturally know characters therefore much more than just arbitrary twist ending performances lindsay crouse joe mantegna add enormously film cannot picture any actor mantegna playing role mike crouse plays role just right restraint suggest repressed criminal mindset work plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay combine create greatest films 1980's truly 
just watched film 3rd time enjoyed lindsay crouse rest cast just as much as just keeps getting better better simply marvel carefully measured way speech slow deliberate action exactly place truly great ones definitely all time favourite 
unique confused woman lindsay crouse gets involved sharp men joe mantegna gives oscar caliber performance as slickest group absolutely enchanting hour as mantegna shows crouse "the ropes" games story line unravels bit later but still stands as unique portrayal innocent caught up dark world definitely worth shot 
house games strong story obsession illusion play big psychologist offers help patient gambling debts gets caught game felt fascination dangerous wrong watch happens pursue urge all way sit edge chair as tricksters tricked victims turn perpetrators you're never sure exactly this quality drawback script as ends feel story lacks bit consistency but all largely compensated excellent psychological development definitely best gambling 
plenty written mamet's "the house games" most good decided revisit flick held up 17 years surprised much enjoyed viewing again film's success durability probably much principal ingredients always fun film good story good scam mamet manages bring signature moodiness obvious histrionics film while scamming audience mark simultaneously explains art conning again all while building story "the house games" freebie cable worth look timers okay rerun mamet fans b+ 
this typical mamet film delivers quiet evenly paced insight makes confidence man joe mantegna good explored as psychological study noted psychologist lindsay crouse slowly pulls world usual nasty consequences cast includes number players mamet's films steven goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy usual good job loved lindsay crouse film often wondered didn't more noted player than i'm not looking right places proceeds slow pace flat dialog yet maintains level tension logically leads bang up ending you'd expect real let ending but uplifting satisfying love 
i enjoyed reasons 1 richard dean anderson 2 amanda tapping performers carried able support regulars recurring actors replacement rda seasons 9 10 enough heart the chemistry all main characters just tremendous feeling actors like pal camera stops rolling relationship carries program rda gives 'o'neill' character believable personality never knows wiseass rest watch roll eyes dismay utterances still know man situation perilous lot going 'carter' 'o'neill' under surface manage lid but often just barely episode 'solitudes' season 1 best drama seen television love prospect dying bearable faced 'carter' 'jackson' often smooth turbulence created 'o'neill' yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always sound understands having think matter team times placed jeopardy not listening orders quality declined markedly seasons 9 10 original story arc mostly used up new villains never really caught interest ben browder far inferior rda carrying rare moments claudia black but all amanda tapping phoning performances seasons greatly changed appearance having baby probably thinking more child than the spin 'stargate atlantis' few moments but mostly weaker effort major characters lack chemistry cast original villains wraiths improbable as ludicrous maybe amanda tapping breathe life program won't fourth season always problem special effects spaceships shaped as pyramids design monstrosity seldom equaled sci fi use torches illumination ships just as bad campy use decor ancient egypt concealing ultra modern technology just as hard accept wondered continuity too season 2 opener 'daniel jackson' shot up uniform gaping hole wounded crawls sarcophagus heals body restores uniform like just came rack wardrobe closet episode 'hathor' sarcophagus fall hands sgc yet never mentioned again device used later episodes 'daniel' 'o'neill' 'dr frasier' 
a film destined late night tv long present instant "money makers" long forgotten little too subtle today's youngsters but time they'll grow appreciation 
this not compared "the sting" caper heist game films makes great experience say relationships deceit trust it's fairly cutting critique psychiatry given female protagonist shrink easily deceived acts primitive manner finale mr mamet unfortunate experience therapy highly hugely recommended 
ask got gun remember taught mark's mindset the gun blanks provided very beginning patient comes end supposed drive away red convertible lead gang splitting up 80 thousand patient the beginning mantegna does not die end gun blanks enough spoilers people giving high ratings it's extremely original hidden ending cons most audience 
i'm big fan films people conned house games almost pinnacle 'films people conned' genre short it's exceptional thriller keeps edge seat providing interesting characters many levels never truly revealing what's happening while throwing many twists surprises upset completely you've just seen film cons audience many occasions despite knowing it's still difficult guess it's going twist comes as surprise as mentioned i'm big fan cons plot follows female psychiatrist receives patient huge debt owed fellow gambler goes gambler attempt help patient way gets drawn art reading people order pull house games breathes sleazy atmosphere david mamet does well establishing film's setting underground levels city film well acted all concerned bringing life believability characters greatest skill joe mantegna stars as man heart film although performance little under wrought he's always solid believable as villain piece lindsay crouse stars alongside as psychiatrist seduced work again believable role not greatest looker but least act way film executes it's plot main star however no doubt amazed multiple occasions as film constantly manages amaze deceive viewer times it's almost like thick action conned men film thing that's great film way shows audience pull certain cons useful you're interested making bucks say all all house games truly rate thrill ride 
spoilers gripping grifters but conning does hunter turn prey gritty dark slow moving seductive pulls drags proverbial garden path waylay just as think safe riveting script good acting least leads didn't notice background music but never jarring right very surprised liked don't usually genre but sucked kept hooked end 
get ready favourite films all time relatively unaware david mamet's writer director works but having watched film half dozen times it's always joy watch say hesitation genius film extremely well written quickly draws milieu deceit artistry room hustles feel film very similar sting 1973 pays homage film noir it's quite psychologically complex film definitely thinking various plot twists motives shady characters slightly predictable times but shocking climax always exciting watch generally acting superb especially joe mantegna but watched film remarked it's not good idea heroine lindsay crouse not gambler smoker thief but sports bad 80's hairdo agree but think nevertheless outstanding role less know plot film better just like mamet's most recent film spanish prisoner ending more impressive just sit prepared taken ride comes dangerously close brilliance 
opening film bach toccata aural hint unfold intense drama all compositional devices bach perfected listener performer intrigued entertained applies film isn't mutual tenderness lead characters lead female final scene feel justified stating raped though victimizer feels forewarned cad mamet compellingly explores emotional chasm differences genders but feel clueless actually compliment given healthy sense humor mamet developed healthy humorous interaction genders wonder work ended as exists very somber mean spirited 
this very nearly perfect film ideas repeated mamet but never told succinctly really failure trust human condition film weaves idea all criminals no innocent alive today hasn't seen play society single day film very much structured like hitchcock thriller except no more innocent characters world completely polluted ruined participating more true don't miss soundtrack wonderful 
wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse just published novel feeling profession feeling it's hopeless help patients young gambling junkie client asks help pay debts truly wants help better gets involved joe mantegna reveal any more plot spoil hell fun 'house games' very well best i've seen david mamet wrote directed gem that's full snappy dialogue great liners enough twists guessing til end crouse perfect as uptight psychiatrist needing change mantegna tops as devilishly sly man exception coincidence quarter the film utter control it's audience loving 
i'm not great writing reviews i'll just spout opinions loved series adventure action comedy drama thought all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis loved all davis fifth most important person cast not big deal but character general hammond left end seventh season anderson's character colonel o'neill moved field office quality series suddenly fell cliff don't know it's hammond more important realized but reason seventh season series turned seven seasons though awesome stargate mediocre time saw but turned wasn't original intention brilliant setup series recommend watch watch season tv series watch again you'll whole new appreciation second time believe watch rest tv series seasons series aren't nearly as good as seven but doesn't mean aren't good just means they're letdown you've gotten spoiled seven seasons finished series sure watch spin series stargate atlantis worthy successor brilliant series edit 7 18 08 just don s davis died few weeks ago great loss 
house games spell binding it's nice occasionally films perfect tens few i've seen grip quickly opening scene just gets i'm trying really hard not to much away not yet seen but few spoilers don't read anymore don't want know say house games not just superb film but best artists seen bar none moment begs replayed lindsay crouse as margaret ford simply perfection mannerisms inflection voice gets role immediately joe mantegna wonderful dialogue unforced almost unscripted quality people communicate as much look as voices loved way filmed grainy surreal type way fit perfectly helped make film few i've seen loved reminded including grifters usual suspects but really house games completely different it's way margaret mike most absorbing characters i've seen big screen not screen chemistry strong palpable moment meet but buildup starts moment set eyes electrifying know something's going happen but no idea just think you've guessed "something" realize haven't scratched surface house games lumped certain genre type but essentially human nature character study not just mind artist but victim as well as moves know more more main characters learn not just say but say it great character study flawless way speeds it's conclusion closing i'd rank 10 10 although not absolute favorite film pretty high list most definitely outstanding far as say does rank as best character studies contains best "twists" i've seen as well although love all types genres comes human psyche really doesn't much better this

jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer aniston combine make funniest far 2003 season late good improvement carrey's past crazy personally forgetable roles past comedies slightly toned carrey antics yet just zap crackle old self carrey powerfully carries height laughter dramatic tearfully somber moments elements jim's real acting abilities continue up this delightful summer entertainment hits most buttons including dramatic elements goofy moments fit perfectly script while still lacking superbly polished ensemble comedy drama bruce almightly deserves credit great date solid message soft spiritual cynicism parody maintains good natured taste stars 
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle as news reporter temporarily gets power god wrecks havoc carrey familiar ground looks having good time jennifer aniston as girlfriend charming affecting story predictible extreme but cast including morgan freeman as "god" great makes film worth catching grade b
well not actually very entertaining though went saw girlfriend night use "i think eye" routine great combination comedy typical romance jim carey superb as luck reporter given power change himself city resides fact all characters great not overly funny sappy good flick wife all all 8 10 note not easy grader thats all bigv 
i glad jim carrey film top wasn't goal character like all wanting more better things happen expecting god deliver morgan freeman great god sense humor genuine sense love yet ready little vacation opportunity presents itself thought jennifer aniston's character little too vulnerable understanding carry's basically self centered tv anchorman wanna but that's way written think previews ruined potentially very funny scenes saw knew coming happened read number reviews people looking little too deep summer comedy not meant solve problems world although few messages all heart funny film 
i very big jim carrey fan laughed ass liar liar ace ventura like serious especially truman cross very funny serious course very funny but parts very serious pulls lot ease truely multi function actor as rest cast happy jennifer aniston's acting think more than just couple nice tits great ass morgan freeman makes very cool god as steven carell limited scenes very funny especially anchor scene overall rate 9 good acting funny script very serious situations make very good film 
i rated series perfect 10 outstanding consistently high quality story character development not episode season 10 final episode 10th season "unending" certainly appear asgard killed very rushed unconvincing very unceremonious fashion left disbelief extremely rushed end series it's obvious many story arcs originally scheduled occur least more season guess rapidly accelerated stories position stargate sg 1 franchise upcoming direct dvd moves unless asgard return future sg 1 very good explanation "apparent" extinction think fans cheated poor clean up loose ends poor end brilliant sci fi series 
i heard film 20 years ago kid grade school just happened thumbing encyclopedias classroom day under entry cinema don't remember stills different mainstream experimental shown page still offon really intrigued stood most page still film scene eye elements superimposed 18 years later public library live available checkout whole 4 dvd set "treasures american film archives" released national film preservation foundation reading notes dvd cases set quite pleasantly surprised offon discs all years finally film viewing it slightly wasn't was expecting tended more organic looking film not that's bad thing but expecting more electronic aesthetic but still impressive film imho considering techniques scott bartlett used make film including hand tinting film itself using video equipment film's scenes filmed video monitor giving more distressed lo res look don't wrong techniques used film quite ground breaking 1972 that's it's still favorite short experimental films creative inspiration as well 
a very funny good jim carrey top form definitely worth price admission morgan freeman jennifer aniston played outstanding supporting roles film think played dog bit too much however still good film 
bruce almighty carrey's best pictures well long time contains funniest scenes seen long time too morgan freeman plays god well chips few jokes surprisingly funny contains romantic moments bit boring but all great funny scenes best scene jim messing up anchor man's voice rating 8 10

i nominate babylon 5 as best television sci fi series stand mind unlike early star trek series consistent evolution plots characters look original star trek star trek tng fine shows but no overall theme plot connected all episodes many ways usually watch shows totally sequence no difficulty understanding occurring less case deep space 9 giant battles took up all final season trek shows as more larger story unified coherence developed as concept babylon 5 saw greater extent sg 1 line many ways series like watching family long novel slowly form sure few "throwaway" episodes not connected rest but very few far usually pretty funny speaking funny loved sg 1 kept mood light time time wasn't dreadfully serious way actually enjoyed more than babylon 5 jack o'neill great character sarcasm love homer simpson it's really too bad slowly faded series later seasons truly appreciate sg 1 watch beginning intricately plots work coherence gives exceptional staying power don't like sg 1 giving fair chance sci fi probably not genre

this "her pilgrim soul" favorite episodes new version twilight zone as mentioned comment new series there's lacking new series maybe emphasize too much lesson learned it's little bit more mawkish sentimental than serling's version however episode considered as quite sentimental too think appeal no matter lovers never unite remember wasn't surprised korean "il mare" later remade "the lake house" think it's saw episode ruined impact later film

this very entertaining few reviews read forum written people apparently think film effort serious drama not way extremely enjoyable film performed tongue cheek manner all actors obviously having fun while entertaining fight sequences lively brisk all not gratuitous called "green death" utilized couple occasions not as read review "gruesome" couple reviewers very critical martial arts fight doc seas near end film hey lighten up again remind all fun film phase "fight" captioned added fun aspect actors not trying emulate bruce lee jackie chan not martial arts films ron ely looks great film perfect choice play doc nice touch unique manner ultimate fate "bad guy" seas dealt promise you don't try film very seriously simply watch entertainment value spend 100 minutes most enjoyable manner 
outragously entertaining period piece set 30s spin classic cliffhanger series as much as "raiders lost ark" low budget much campier director michael anderson opening scenes laces liberal gothic art nuveau predating batman decades starring ron ely tarzan as perfectly cast hero gorgeous pamela hensley as local latina mona tagging hero goldhunt non existent latin american country hidalgo best line hero mona holding fist chin just as expect tender her hug "mona you're brick "paul wexler's ham cheese blackhat captain seas absolute delight expect little "raiders " dash "batman" little "the lost world" little "lost horizons" whole lot campiness you'll just right watch cult favorite michael berryman small as undertaker enjoy campy use john philip sousa's patriotic music prime candidate dvd release certainly overdue unmissable treat whole family 9 10
i brought up doc savage petrified green death as child but as thoroughly entertaining countless friends colleagues watch film most amused diversity reactions granted mostly think i'm odd but "i don't know doc but always gets girls" ultimate line look sad band men film classic spoof all super hero genre way it's time not taken seriously austin powers ron ely god unfortunate film hasn't released dvd uk don't think remade bastardised like said it's classic cannot ron like italian job mini's michael caine 10 10 
we often talk cinema landmarks kane godfather bout souffle film however too often overlooked "serious" film critics talking course classic doc savage m o b film not exciting but seriously explores issue exploitation developing nations imperialism not mention kung fu possessed greatest soundtrack film history course queen's breathtaking work flash gordon although bit rarity film well worth seeking repay effort search fold 
the makers chosen best people job set scene wonderfully interior full tells all people live period 20s story present 1950 middle story 1910s costumes settings lovingly observed created love fussy costumes old ladies sanatorium exquisite lace overlaid finest shetland shawls roland culver as ashenden very appealing but never mind soppy young lovers it's raymond huntley as man resents wife's health independence harrows emotions usually played comical pompous types but subtle convincing very impressive china seas great 30s film starring gable harlow stole plot mr know all episode nicked story kipling wish saw more naunton wayne as jealous husband though good moment looking melancholy mexican hat love posh bird plays wife too 
trio's vignettes insightful quite enjoyable curious seeing many soon famous actors very young performances attention wonderful watch observation film isn't necessary source material alignment contemporary era interesting worthwhile "small morality" storytelling quaint coy eye beholder thankfully story content well told overcome it's time subject place ironically quite few contemporary films today not overcome conventions cutting edge mores present era inserting "small morality" content occasionally provide dimension lacking 
this actually trilogy 3 somerset maugham's short tales the verger 15 minutes long very enjoyable 17 years albert foreman laid church job can't read nor write does opens tobacco shop course second mr know all actually story read school 6 years ago instantly forgotten heard familiar introduction 15 minute very good worked better film than book but that's 14 time afterall 3rd nearly let almost hour length simply drags it's not all bad but not as quick snappy as 2 watched quarter hour skipped forward quarter hour still sense really hadn't missed thing overall 8 9 6 10 respectively

wilhelm grimm alexander knox stands trial nazi crimes witnesses evidence father warecki henry travers wilhelm's brother karl erik rolf wilhelm's lover marja marsha hunt wilhelm speaks defense film ends court sums up film told flashback segments as witnesses takes stand story mostly set small polish village memorable scenes include village reaction death anna shirley mills wilhelm accused raping treatment jewish villagers as prepare moved concentration camps church service willie grimm richard crane denounces nazi upbringing whilst mourning girlfriend janina dorothy morris marja's daughter shot brothel film knox unrepentant very convincing as bitter resentful evil man martha hunt powerful moments matches strength henry travers very good role as priest film delivers effective story stays finished 
this wonderful little american propaganda film highly creative openly discusses nazi atrocities entire extent death camps revealed while late 1944 1945 reveal just evil horrific film unlike hollywood films date most brutally honest film era seen regarding nazi atrocities film begins courtroom future war film 1944 war ended 1945 fictitious world court nazi leader tried war crimes wilhelm grimm totally unrepentant one witnesses called reveal grimm's life 1919 series flashbacks appears film going sympathetic explain grimm pushed join nazis however while very apparent grimm just sadistic monster episodes amazingly well definitely hold interest make film less like piece propaganda but legitimate drama all all film does great job considering film mostly stars second tier actors many compelling scenes performances especially very prescient jewish extermination scene end can't help but bring close tears interesting point film super creative scenes use crosses way not notice overall it's history lovers wants good film fyi not meant as serious criticism film but hitler referred as "that paper hanger" reference myth hitler money putting up wallpaper fact not true previously he'd "starving artist" homeless person served well german army wwi horrible person yes but never paper hanger 
never viewed film recently tcm story concerning poland small town suffer nazi occupation local towns just like many european cities example norway world war people town still suffering lost soldiers wounded war always creates alexander knox wilhelm gimm "gorky park" returns war lost leg school teacher town brought up german not very happy polish people turn did not fully accept either as hitler party grew power wilhelm grimm desired nazi order return punish small polish town treatment really all mind marsha hunt marja pacierkowski "chloe's prayer" played outstanding role as woman lost husband romantically involved whilhelm gimm many flashbacks very real truths nazi destroyed people's families entire lives cattle cars shown picture jewish people heading nazi gas chambers not seen film like subject matter time film very earth 1944 film story not forget too quickly 
the reason 8 10 few opinion perfect little b picture taut story well told i've always intrigued alexander knox but seen very few plays wilhelm grimm sad little man turns monster betrays everybody ounce remorse performance most chilling performances i've seen world war 2 actors played nazis evil types films occasionally nominated oscars imagine war academy felt like honoring performance like like honoring evil but knox puts kind performance man bitter consumed guilt thinks nothing making suffer still can't marsha hunt usually plays filbert gibbet social butterfly cast against type probably best performance i've seen too maybe not oscar worthy but best career nothing against enjoyed "slight" roles often played but proves up task heavier drama like human drama stories stories fates suffered hands nazis highly recommend fine little film 
this tough watch as earlier reviewer says amazing considering terrible films came right wwii particularly "liberation" dachau clear as middle war knew exactly happening jews sequence shows "transport" vivid almost as based actual newsreel nazis liked record atrocities knox as nazi brilliant charts course nazi career charting particularly telling contrasted reactions germans laughing hitler incredulous finally helpless contrast however permits believe "conversion" young nazi officer anti nazi stance did happen as witness attempts against hitler most notably staffenberg plot occurred as film coming strong film effectively using flashbacks accurately predicting nuremburg trails occur war ended

delightful minor film juggling comedy detective romance drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams melvyn douglas balances devotion girl maxine carroll joan blondell duty force as ace detective hodge podge not appeal all viewers today but day offer member going family resolution tired feeling versus duty plot original refreshing well worth wait "the amazing mr williams" contains most outrageous blind dates film history bright comic repartee sparkles ludicrously frocked melvyn douglas delivers best lines "i'd walk main street turkish towel i'd let any woman control life " effervescent joan blondell lets barbs fly typical aplomb "good grief look like aunt nellie 'the crime solving standard fare although fine cast character actors helps bring material life today's vantage point "the amazing mr williams" most interesting insightful commentary gender as socially defined construct all more malleable seemingly rigid boundaries while much gender commentary takes place superficial battle sexes times subtle penetrating playing not finer details film but battle genres reaches culmination final scene 
this very good screenplay enchanting but meryl streep most impressive performance excellent brings heart role 
this feel strongly need making all generally speaking fan based worthy true stories great meryl's performance gained lot recognition praise movie's greatest asset story based riveting tale couple suffer social legal torture having undergone enormous emotional pain unexpected brutal death infant child really eye opening fable exposes inhumane fellow humans uncovers barbarism very refined lawful society interesting people consider as kind intelligent people emotional jury ladies example reality nothing more than selfish dupes dogmatic beliefs prejudices shut brains any deliberation contemplation light all facts pointing very clearly against opinions face called "civilized" society exposes apathy pain fellow human beings needless say very general though specific tale unfolds australia goes as far as true cruelty willing serious thought provoking 
i believe telling truth whole time u cant trust wild family went hell poor boys too young understand going but still having deal rumours as well as dealing lose little sister cant believe case went long like jury couldn't truth bit ass feel family let know hate happened no idea went cant imagine watching tears check little girl bed think watch

fascinating based true story australian woman lindy chamberlain meryl streep accused killing baby daughter insists dingo took baby but story highly suspicious film actually media circus took place case way australians interpreted presented media lynch mob mentality ultimately led woman's conviction based barely any hard evidence love films question media films hard look people railroaded justice i've always thought juries ought showed 12 angry men duties it's not as often said liberal but clinical look as human beings interpret events based much prejudices desire revenge dark likewise clinical schepisi careful not make film all melodramatic film boring dry but engaging

this intelligent more than most transcends least common denominator stupid people probably not appreciate story relies heavily dialogue parallels lost translation although sunrise much brighter less abstract simply lot better script characters slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely seen script acting melted perfectly dialogue moves very personal issues risk little top does however stay right almost all time although few moments little awkward embarrassing balancing fine line demands outrageously talented actors yields great results overall simply stupendous very very rarely "love" films depicted way trustworthy realistic time achieved result fantastic think stunning apparently timeless beauty female lead actress helped quite bit respect still looks stunning film 12 years simply gem can't miss best seen 1990s 
before sunrise many remarkable things going almost too many fit review like but it's suffice say it's most observant character studies nineties maybe all contemporary cinema observant not love say much as it's human connection does fall love sight no does least that's deep consensus linklater wants film yet possibility as intense connection bond form young many ideas expressed articulately breadth cynicism very tender true time linklater gives story celine jessie french girl american boy train heading vienna way start talking things arbitrary personal jessie seeing death time great grandfather jessie persuades celine night 'town' vienna plane morning sunrise gives jessie celine midst gorgeous vienna scenery locales on subjects lot importance sense act having conversations it's like watch people having leading another it's often relationships commitments as jessie celine tell stories somewhat inconsequential seemingly tell lot essential qualities hear confessions desires loves weren't really loves family upbringing not inform you'll love life means believe not believe religious form just connection any faith soul loved bit quakers church laced cynicism skepticism jessie more responsible but what's fascinating film it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting cynicism lays concerns men women age lives it's always great ethan hawke julie delpy roles they're not incessantly annoying 90s generation x mode but kinds people not central conceit film isn't bad all but necessary one think walking streets city conceit old romantic picture ala brief encounter intimacy expressed central characters either sweet asides actually acceptable "i tell secret" jessie says leans kiss ho ho little moments pop up people way loved scene poet it's very cinematic thing suddenly random romantic bit player midst romantic picture beautiful words disposal palm reader reactions jessie celine share but really seeing hand all while hawke delpy embody roles interestingly neuroses formed adult lives as lead future featuring splendid cinematography script ear natural wit true sense means moment happiness however self contained as lead more who's say can't suddenly attached less than 24 hours much more attached than married couple linklater's thesis but there's more than just it's very dense film calling repeatedly scene especially cheesy brilliant talking 'on phone' mimicking expositions other's friend a+
this truly truly best love i've seen closely followed none than "before sunset" technically isn't all it's people romance "love" real world ok that's most people as intelligent eloquent as leads reading reviews pleases know many folks crazy dialog based as well makes "before sunrise" good dialog perfect it's real engaging funny it's hardly surprise jesse celine fall love 'coz fall love very time favorite scene the coffee shop pretend phone best friends pretending said best friend it's perfect brings very moment fell love very time life say choice watch "before sunrise" watching "before sunset" like watched "sunset" it's hard shake feeling pity sadness young lovers entire again greatest romantic books wonderful acting excellent script beautiful locations young love it's best

i never heard film couple weeks ago but concept interested heard american man meets european woman night europe spend night talking sparked interest but never expected great sunrise masterpiece it's most romantic films record surprise completely lacked cynicism 1990s it's impossible really talk too much no real plot speak although plenty thoroughly interesting things talk sort like dinner andre conversation but it's not just conversation matters but let just say see

probably all time favorite story selflessness sacrifice dedication noble cause but it's not preachy boring just never gets old despite having seen 15 more times 25 years paul lukas' performance brings tears eyes bette davis very few truly sympathetic roles delight kids as grandma says more like "dressed up midgets" than children but makes more fun watch mother's slow awakening what's happening world under roof believable startling dozen thumbs they'd all "up"

i enjoyed film yet hated wanted help guy fifties lot friends music business still trying adults no more fans groupies money having hard time adjusting regular life as new bands getting spotlight almost like begin anew film testament lot old rockers 70's 80's going that's film sad depressing but portrays life old rock star abandoned lost believable way young girl arrives decrepit home reminds hollis maclaren outrageous lady film cheer film folks 50's seen rise fall bands people knew members watched hurt as age creeps popularity fades almost perfect sad but way positive whales 
i bad frame mind saw reason clicked all levels tensions family loneliness want share life didn't hurt share life beautiful girl as claire cyndy preston bought sound track very hard loved hope someday come dv
i amazingly impressed contained fundamental elements depression grief loneliness despair hope dreams companionship wasn't merely genius musician hit rock but man caught up grief trying drastically solace music finds companion comes issues claire des able provide friendship love but more importantly conclusion events shaped life worst des unlikely character todays standards rock star yet musical genius event past stagnate while things literally ruins focus creating whale music fact obsession claire streetwise kid needs place stay finds hidden talents while des company finds mutual friend accepts learns trust period time love not mind blowing sex infused kind passion but love friendship understanding means more people hurt trust 
a friend recommended citing vocal inflective similarities des howl movie's main character guess extent bit more i'm not very sure not that's flattering portrayal pretty unique work more than glancing similarity true romance not content style filming pace dialogue whale music just much more well relaxed but instead represent modern love stories general i'm big fan canadian music musicians example highly recommend hard core logo film particular innocent charm des not always most likeably guy but there's draws sterling sort empathy

after oscar nominated turn "secrets lies" brenda blethyn starred equally great "saving grace" let tell not sort day husband commits suicide grace trevethyn brenda blethyn discovers irresponsible financial decisions left massive debt fortunately finds way make ends meet marijuana that's right grace starts cultivating aspect played great effect isn't dull moment sure didn't end scene coming but gotta just feel more than little festive seeing nothing function as good lesson knowing one's finances but course there's lot more than 
this light hearted comedy enjoyed entertainment value gets quite hysterically funny times but haven't spent any time 'that' tracks miss comedy erupts cast characters meld well quite believable roles grace handles meeting dead husbands girlfriend well played she's true lady favorite grace's white pimp suit wears highly recommend flick wants laugh loud cheers underdog just wishes watch different

first bough vhs than just buy dvd favorite all time read book but really think much better loved gwyneth paltrow as emma jeremy northam as mr knightley excellent chose brilliant it's 10 10 
emma horribly flawed film based jane austens classic novel not read book really didn't know much plot yet still predicted nearly entire plot many scenes frustrated bad writing directing film though reason very entertaining loved course all scenes disliked but majority well acted funny gwyneth paltrow gives best performances as heroine emma film stars toni collette okay but much better ewan mecgreger better but still very good alan cumming never really impressed pretty much jeremy northam who's performance wooden look but actually fairly subtle not needed much better adaptations jane austen books but still very entertaining worth watching 
a slight charming little sure but superbly crafted gwyneth paltrow shines early showcase british accent cast assembled all lap up dialogue came time sense sensibility i'm sure don't know garnered all oscar attention emma jane austen's most accessible least stuffy story told well 
lavish production values solid performances straightforward adaption jane austen's satirical classic marriage game classes provincial 18th century england northam paltrow salutory mixture as friends pass jealousies lies discover love good humor sustaining virtue goes long way explaining accessability aged source material toned bit harsh scepticism liked look film shots set up thought didn't rely too much successions head shots like most films 80s 90s very good results 
wrapped gorgeous english country backgrounds emma delicious confection relished dreamy getaways emma gwyneth paltrow graceful intelligent young woman just married governess confidant marriage emma takes credit matchmaking eager use talent arranging things people decides match vicar mr elton alan cummings pretty young friend harriet toni collette result series mixed signals mistaken interpretations end up sorting emma learning did not as much control events as thought film full jane austen's witty wry characterizations gwyneth paltrow best portraying maiden restrained polite society wit ease growing romance unparalleled mr knightley jeremy northam heart film mr knightley greatest romantic leading men films incredibly handsome modest relaxed way irresistible certainly well matched gwyneth paltrow charming friendship began 16 infant blossomed as family friend matches wits older brotherly fashion grows more wry look understated jab emma northam's knightley delight watch wonderful characterizations include comic juliet stevenson greta scacchi ewan mcgregor polly walker talkative spinster miss bates very funny shorter more flowing than most jane austin adaptations emma comic rhythm promises true enjoyment 
i'm huge jane austen fan feature length film true fan wants as little left as possible achieved mini series really great gwyneth paltrow really captures slightly clueless but well intentioned rich girl jeremy northam mr knightly poise nobility wasn't thrilled ewan mcgregor though like very much as actor but didn't feel spoiled all like said as jane austen fan things liked seen included weren't but much longer than permissible feature length film as felt really encapsulated story well i've seen adaptation book felt best 
this powerful documentary domestic abuse cameroon "sisters" law female lawyers judges 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands abusive treatment spouses won woman divorce desperately wanted muslim council long hours but fascinating terms individual plaintiffs defendants lawyers successfully represented court rooms presided female judges leave as left many questions exactly change occurred did women come occupy positions authority cameroon cases featured film significant effect treatment women generally spouses granting divorce muslim court against express wishes husband time event i'm not suggesting film makers answered questions years ago not yesterday deserves wide audience 
i saw jane austen addicted always feeling doubtful cinematographic rendering complexity novels well transposition simply accurate intelligent delicate careful tactful respectful intense word perfect "emma" austen's most delightful funny novels thanks overall irony pervading situations characters respected subtle irony not disregarding comic element miss bates all engaged novel renders clearly deep knowledge human life shown english novelist modern look women men relation handled astounding think woman novelist 18th century lived almost secluded life grasp depth truth life as did most still fascinates feel modernity just replace costumes use more current language but situations feelings ideas extremely modern think morbid interest people's lives insinuating envy as rule women's relations still difficulty revealing giving expression one's feelings especially love situation gets universal time value cast really talented offer very good extremely brilliant performances young gwyneth paltrow particularly suitable role nowadays probably too mature toni colette simply great envied wonderful dresses wear breathtaking english countryside situation gets magic dream like dimension really enjoyable deserving 
well guess i'm emotionally attached it's went more than 10 times cinema helping master's thesis keeping working but watching again years many many later well crafted little gem i've never seen gwyneth paltrow more convincing performance jeremy northam perfect mr knightley does meet man sophie thompson's turn as ms bates virtuoso acting finest oh napkins sorry rest cast no disappointment either toni colette brings lot muriel harriet ewan mcgregor convincingly charming alan cumming juliet stevenson perfect "impossible" couple course sets costumes beautiful soundtrack contribute lot feelgood almost hobbiton like atmosphere although as far as cinematography art decoration it's almost case visual overload very very pretty but little more austerity conveyed better sense period but good thing doesn't itself too seriously plenty fun pretty cool editing sinking saccharine merry old england mode particular favorite ball scene beautiful acting directing concluding dance summarizes relationship emma mr knightley just beautifully pity final proposal scene goes just little too long cut shots think exactly ones much more keeping rest gosh just realize reading imdb listings i've seen jeremy northam least aware he's got lot more going as actor than just gentlemanlike english heartthrob hmm guess need pay video store visit lovely favorite jane austen adaptation far though ang lee's sense sensibility strictly speaking better closest heart i've certainly seen many more times watch don't too hard little imperfections 
emma true romance love soppy stuff charged wit folly love true novel very important few twists added pleasure gwen not fave actreesess but does justice role required offer spades shines role think no actress proper justice jeremy northam as hero shocked never looked as overtly handsome but heck right role looks good as sensible regal mr k literally looking new light makes excellent romantic lead charm character brings role wonderful ewan mcgregor greta sacchi brings rest good cast good fan jane austen pride prejudice most importantly buy books enhances heights extraordinary

every time film bbc somebody radio times says satire against post war world rationing welfare state not think point film all film parodies spivs small time criminals ran blackmarket housewives league campaigned against government restrictions but really tory organisation yes course film sends up political social situation but end people realise need all controls ensure fair society want british muddle than foreign but don't think exactly like 
i commend pictures try different many films just like treads old ideas big reason strongly recommend passport pimlico set just ww2 post war shortages rationing driving londoners "barmy" film centers tiny neighborhood london called pimlico too sick not able buy want but no way accidentally stumble hidden treasure charter officially named neighborhood as sovereign nation many hundreds years ago document reason bypass all rationing coupons live life just as want turns really aren't british subjects goes crisis ultimately resolved you'll need leave up brilliant minds ealing studios come up gem 
very funny well crafted well acted meticulous attention real window specific time place history almost believe true story parallel universe interesting passport pimlico anticipates berlin airlift definite 10 
spoilers many different comedy series nowadays point experimented idea obscure independence early episode cartoon "family guy" griffin family home independent nation united states america story progresses way 1949 however ealing studios produced wonderful little film idea child's prank residents pimlico discover small fortune treasure inquest clear small area small outcrop long lost state burgundy withdrawing london rest great britain residents small street experience joys problems independent state based time rationing still operation story brilliantly told equally inspiring featuring performances stanley holloway betty warren philip stainton young charles hawtrey film well stocked finest actors generation actors well aided as well superb little script cracking lines feeling remarkably fresh despite 50 years old story never feels awkward always keeps audience entertained ealing studios finest exporters british film existence films like "passport pimlico" it's not difficult amusing start finish story always fun always worth watching

i say totally loved it's funny moments heartwarming parts just all good personally really liked it's finally relate childhood opinion geared more young gay population shows young gay boy treated while growing up all taunting calling not knowing like most young feminine boys always remember finally illustrates hard really grow up gay definitely recommend seeing probably shouldn't really watch person old mature enough understand it
i tired 4 5 year old daughters constantly subjected watch nickelodeon disney like all old tired cartoons rehashed over again daughters couldn't fair afternoon sick wanted just relax rest while flipped tv searching different flipped channels finger stopped channel surfing moment heard harvey's voice adore single solitary thing man saw doing voice work little duck well couldn't change channel daughters instantly mesmerized cartoon more watched more grew love message portrayed it's not necessarily proponent "gay rights" but ostracized as child friends picked thing too fat too skinny too feminine bully not smart enough having parent kids as rule very very cruel happy entertaining cartoon actually conveyed life message audience girls accept as don't pick different older daughter actually stands up friends they're picked happens single mom little girl picked quite often warms heart kassie stands up condemning feel it's advocate "gay rights" forced "accept certain views" clearly completely missed point poignant little cartoon need explained well need more help than any television offer 
i just finished watching film very enjoyable quiet little film doesn't overwhelm special effects "big" performances simply takes lives people living small hamlet backwoods north carolina henry thomas gives good performance as raymond toker young loner finds baby abandoned woods toker's search baby's parents takes journey profound impact life david srathairn plays truman lester slimy conman ulterior motive david plays bad guy perfection much more film than meets eye filmed location north carolina wonderful sound track traditional music worth watching 
henry thomas "great" character held attention "into" story forgot wasn't real wanted baby special person people story essential makeup character way banded help truly awe inspiring love real human emotions having hit head not smart enough figure things 
this most interesting seen love backwoods feel very realistic believable place era maybe late 60's early 70's henry thomas works well young baby very moving story worth look 
i saw film night cable extraordinary love most understated low key but deeply heartfelt henry thomas' played child e t performance masterfully inarticulate supposed man few words david straithern wonderful crazy villain miraculously given we're talking hollywood product baby serves as main character but doesn't act lines but just is luminous interesting note thomas' mysterious relationship w e t core film while bond w baby serves as core "a good baby "then music ah music gillian welch's tunes wonderful entire score gorgeous hill country music film wonderfully atmospheric recommend highly 
dark angel cross huxley's brave new world percy's love ruins portraying not too distant future as disturbing mixture chaos order worst sense word swallows premise all modern technology brought standstill "the pulse " provides entertaining landscape exploring personalities relationships primary characters max dark angel bike messenger logan rich rebel uneven result variety authors but held energetic beautiful charming jessica alba strong calloused yet vulnerable sensitive think fox again 
a sweet natured young mountain man sad past henry thomas comes abandoned baby girl woods instantly falls love town elders generally support keeping child though local temptress cara seymour thinks little new family determined little girl long walk sinister travelling salesman david strathairn creepiest parallel stories converge fateful way charming slice life ozarks vein as "where lillies bloom" "the dollmaker" all shot location beautiful hills cover lives simple living but not simple minded american folk minimum strong language brief but pointed violence make fairly safe family viewing 
what reviewer called lack character development understatement didn't bash head overexplanation unnecessary backstory yes many untold stories got glimpse but primarily day snapshot event catalyzed change all characters' lives henry thomas's performance really lovely study power acting focuses reaction than action good rental

simply best come michigan well evil dead eat heart hatred minute oddest best cinema seen reviewer long time recommend need head trip good case willies 
"hatred minute" hauntingly beautiful film psychological thriller takes journey nightmare life serial killer eric seaver strong performances excellent cinematography make film "must see" any film student horror fan realness story human eric separate film psycho killer shout outs film's producer bruce campbell as well as film "the evil dead" add humor knows genre 
michael kallio gives strong convincing performance as eric seaver troubled young man horribly mistreated as little boy monstrous abusive alcoholic stepfather barry genuinely frightening portrayal gunnar hansen eric compassionate fianc sweetly played lovely tracee newberry job transcribing autopsy reports local morgue haunted bleak past egged bald beaming jack demon truly creepy michael robert brandon sent edge recent death mother eric goes deep end embarks brutal killing spree capably directed kallio wrote tight astute script uniformly fine acting sound no cast jeff steiger especially good as eric's wannabe helpful guardian angel michael rough but overall polished cinematography george lieber believable true life characters jolting outbursts raw shocking unflinchingly ferocious violence moody spooky score dan kolton uncompromisingly downbeat ending grungy detroit michigan locations grimly serious tone taut gripping narrative stays steady track extremely potent gritty psychological horror thriller makes often absorbing disturbing viewing real sleeper 
so constitutes real independent film day age latest fad mainstream hollywood appear rugged cutting edge i'm sorry say general public tends perceive as independent film usually nothing more than clever marketing ploy glad films like "hatred minute" exist board film makes point contradicting template indie horror film love hate "hatred" isn't afraid watching film real sense kallio director didn't just make film spray fake blood all place he's tell stories good ones film horror film section video store but don't fooled story love good people pushed edge oh distant light end tunnel expect smut evil dead ripoff stay away film but dig finer points horror suspense genres check film yes bruce campbell did produce i'm sure he's proud tell it's not "evil dead" bruce never tried bank "ash" image it's obvious didn't involved "hatred" either advice though all dead ites rabidly devouring issued mr campbell check film mr kallio mr campbell trying acting well although nothing film oscar caliber intentionally it's good compassionate performances horror film often actors films as don't try "hatred" as though all actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting typical horror film campiness technically "hatred" as competent as indie film gets editing fast paced cinematography good given budget "hatred" keeps quick pace any bog points bad anti climaxes all all hatred not glossed look all multi million dollar fake indies but personally don't problem it's film folks actually care medium people reached thier broke ass pockets pulled thier nickles dimes threw caution wind damn good check 
michigan edgar allen poe toaster frying pan don't mind psycho thriller horror film genre special place heart twisted amazingly well developed film "hatred minute" all draw mainstream hits like "silence lambs" cult classics like "army darkness " editing effects well better than many films genre kallio weaves intricate tale torment drawing bible poe's writings time big budget big films lack much way substance independent film resurrected dying trait love michigan good story decent thriller check "hatred minute "
i think definitely greatest jessica alba does great job michael weatherly does awesome job as well as rest cast very intriguing wonderful storylines stunts amazing it's like watching 1 hour it's definitely worth watching 
i think unfortunate leading comments include words "clueless appalling nonsense " think very funny excellent entertainment suspend one's disbelief homosexual man lesbian woman fall love child live happily but always wonderful played one's heart warmed impossible far more implausible events described acting good script funny negative comment story well ended family drives away initial house instead extending explore man retains any residual homosexuality 
this film seen wife came 1978 revelation actually thought gay lesbian couple married children obviously wrong love come don't expect maybe don't want but chose love no never changed sexual orientation kind stuff christian wackos young affairs but never opposite sex as aged stopped having extramarital affairs story not far fetched however suggestion heterosexuals pretty unrealistic wife sleeping 40 years still gay end story 
this film entertainment did not think world social commentary small film personally film funny audacious memorable fantasy not unlike cinder girl princess film very well add 70's time best experiments film able mention person's sexuality not person homosexual not however love all it's strange forms film does realities gay 70's hollywood california pretty boys looked older not pretty men women stay deeply locked emotional closet risk not having career bathhouses integral gay community fantasy begins let mix lesbian gay add liquor well any way better than dismal redo "the big thing" asked entire crew try better enjoyed saw 70's still brings smile lips heartily advise wants funny tender curl up popcorn fun people need lighten up film 
this as unique as overlooked different story just shows need survive maintain capacity love open heart as well as open mind saw cable late 70's truly depicted limitations gay community time believe ahead time depicting little slice obscure way life truly classic sense precursor depicted as extended family film available dvd vhs not extra ordinary performances meg foster perry king acknowledged but far come still relationships concerned 
in order stop homosexual friend albert perry king deported belgium stella meg foster decides marry problem that stella herself lesbian separate lives night albert's birthday party fall bed love later film falling love stella suspects albert cheating shows up job night late closing finds leave viewer stunned great film very original perry king meg foster good roles amazing not better recognized work very controversial release 1978 "r" rated film "pg" much more liberal time recently released dvd disc contains "making of" segment special features it's stated film based actual story viewers say film not "real" mistaken individual different people fall love different reasons issues explored wonderful film loved 
i appreciated photography textures colours often unlike comment lighting lacking coherent storyline often disjointed badly edited times difficult follow version 110 minutes imdb shows 125m possibly cuts subtitles didn't help applaud any films escape hollywood mould but left disappointed miss gillain luminous performances all fine just wanted little more dialogue like film affinity try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet 
this story complex wonderful tale harem ottoman empire well told provoking inner workings world gone learn people lived enjoyed story characters acting scenes few scenes suffered quick editing sub titles disappeared too quickly wonderful piece main character safiya played wonderfully marie gillain pleased say did fantastic job doing scenes alex descas nadir charming lovely recommend film anybody looking watch less hollywood more authentic world emulating

i can't understand fans genre didn't like film truly lot fun special effects wonderful generally agree reviews imdb voters but not time waited came home video felt reason wouldn't enjoy film believe special effects films need seen big screen but again not case film begs comparison films released time blair witch mummy films thought terrible blair probably most overrated horror film all time mummy gobs money pure dreck people liked it's special effects films like mummy haunting not rich character development more like funhouse rides well analogy mummy b ticket haunting's e ticket 
what say hasn't said "the haunting" make great picture wonderful sets moody music sound design die all place screenplay though boggles mind weird surrealistic way entire team forgotten read maybe too busy creating cg effects building gothic sets notice weak plot member cast gives worthy performance although little conviction material hand lili taylor most while mostly react but that's all say slightly enjoyable hours but definitely want more lot more 
i just got puzzled damn fox canceled season3 although season2 not as good as season1 excellent like much thinking buying dvd amazon failed chinese student it's inconvenient international credit card $ just hope fox bring da someday 
i rented this past weekend cranked up surround sound got great sound special affects great rental special affects enough scare fiance but noticed looked suprisingly generated didn't but scary late night don't feel like going recommend 
i don't know critics trashed hardly agree little scarier don't usually horror psych myself up daytime needn't bothered happy cinema full kids too heh happy liam great as always liked catharine zeta jones theo lili taylor eleanor nell house very gothic beautiful spooky way special sound effects awesome loved music score particularly gentle tunes eleanor journey save children grew stagnant routine life finally gain power peace freedom 
i know fashionable hate seen hundreds spook films including original 1963 haunting as well as most hammer films film not restrained does not hold all probably many modern viewers not like yet many viewers accept control films like scream knife killers more easy believe most people than demons ghosts actually film many great scenes acting special effects great seen 15 times gets better time director film number interesting stylish films not trying type realism 6th sense haunting lets certainly not boring film appeal more john carpenter fans but more traditional plot structure old haunting fine film 1963 more scary innocents legend hell house pamela franklin

as disclaimer i've seen 5 6 times 15 years just saw musical week allowed judge tainted wasn't musical however tainted watched musical happy actually believe michael douglas worked quite well role kasey think 'let dance scene' best parts worthwhile addition compared musical dancers singing much superior musical as well as cast least 10 times bigger easier course decors lighting dancing singing much superior expected delivered songs common musical better the new ones quite good ones whole just delivers more than musical opinion especially compared musical few decors bad point the obvious cuts actors talking dubbed singers singing portions characters but dancing impeccable end product more enjoyable than musical

i watched seeing broadway love broadway musical love watched like not related broadway avid reader seen happens most books turned developed philosophy really early assume going based book musical case but while story line similar not different watch danced 12 years make choice good dancer picking up chorus work local productions as child but wasn't super talented however super talented as rider told dance instructor trainer spent months year farm state make choice turned 14 needed up dancing hours days week riding 3 hours day 7 days week dedicate dearly love dancing love lot ballet dance just chose watch it great raw emotion human interaction power anticipation heartbreak work really hard want just not love love broadway musical

this great film time saw thought absorbing start finish still not seen play but wouldn't stop thinking film just as good 
i love mean story not best but dancing most certainly makes up know little bit character way want learn just think won't like unless you're broadway 
anyone seen reviewed poorly refer roger ebert's review most respected critics industry gave 3 1 2 stars great not perfect spectacular but enjoyed chorus line not much story as group stories lives broadway hopefuls read reviews people said too much time wasted romance zach cassie incorrect view story all stories told broadway hopefuls people fail realize dancers broadway shows things common man goes think really point whole showcase not talent special dancers but poignant things think regard life general study life as broadway star dreamed broadway star watches great feeling relationship gone exactly characters going great musical slow points times gets little confused pacing certain story lines but all all thoroughly enjoyed closer look maybe understand talking 
hi all people seen wonderful im sure thet liked as much as i love songs seen sing as though singing dancing dancing singing song all time fave musical song too strutters end mirror oh watch one

in watching early demille work again reinforced early demille far superior late demille attention use light scenes remarkable pacing very good enabling much told space hour pity wasn't as intuitive style later sound films as silent films film seen cleo ridgely remarkable quite restrained yet conveyed broad spectrum emotions ending wonderful 
and nicole kidman fanatic pay hear read moscow phone book all know doing speaking russian all principals excellent but itself number good images better scenes held nothing while always ready suspend disbelief while watching asks too much viewer very funny parts quite frightening scene but director didn't know way 
i confess completely shocked film went whim expecting mediocre but given most shocking thing was populist american cinema all british comedy finest dark quirky funny ways american films just never stop short however recommending wholeheartedly went people english european american while loved mainly groups hated it worthless think you're kind thing not don't 10 10 
i didn't really know expect going watch film apart slightly surreal basic plotline lonely man orders russian bride internet nicole kidman absolutely loved film though came thinking 'wow' refreshingly earth film moves nicely few suprises corner relationships film believeable nicole chaplin working against beautifully humour subtle great 'office' like scenes bank thriller element add tension hollywood overall film real people unusual situation it's less heroics more delicate relationships brit filmmaking best 9 10 
as usual hollywood stereotyped but classic uptight white collar banker russian woman well facial expressions great language perfect russian language nicole did splendid job hey guys you pay happy 
i think dark angel great season excellent good plot max jessica alba as escaped x 5 manticore creation trying adapt normal life but still "saving world" hunted manticore season gives series extra spice second season though suddenly bit odd compared the plot kinda disappeared series lost little it's charm mostly all weird "creatures" appearing don't wrong second season good but little bit much "manticores" however managed to new promising plot closing episodes season 2 lot hopes more really wish start making new episodes james cameron can't wrong as conclusion say it's great series however i'm still hoping season 
excellent albeit slightly predictable comment nicole kidmans acting works haven't shown amazing talent woman but birthday girl doesn't suffer slightest words kidmans acting shines 
good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman almost always like she's good "vehicle" adept comedy drama elements romantic comedy wrapped crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good good good but unpopular romantic comedy "truth cats dogs" maybe they're too implausible ebert didn't post review great "screwball" comedies obviously totally implausible "bringing up baby" you've seen implausible comedy you've seen all maybe people ready 1930s weird birthday girl i've enjoyed times nicole kidman "killer app" home video 
this great little film that's very unique creative great plot twists wonderful performances all characters great story while bizarre fascinating very interesting plus nicole kidman simply amazing it's very hard really quite bizarre it's comedy romance minute turns thriller however still very entertaining all plus nicole's russian accent fantastic extremely convincing chaplin kidman very good chemistry loved vincent cassel's performance plus plot twists really took surprise ending very cute it's unpredictable plus quite underrated as well feel sorry chaplin way scammed thought all characters really likable plus finale especially good nicole's though carries incredibly sexy performance great little film that's very unique creative great plot twists wonderful performances highly recommend direction very good jez butterworth does very good job great camera work solid angles keeping film fast pace acting wonderful nicole kidman stunningly gorgeous amazing as always incredibly sexy very likable coolest accents added lot presence very good chemistry ben chaplin very mysterious character amazing kidman rules ben chaplin great extremely likable cool character very good chemistry kidman thing didn't like taking anger kidman though did wrong loved got revenge end vincent cassel fantastic as main villain yes ott but very intense quite creepy times role perfect mathieu kassovitz ok but didn't much rest cast fine overall highly recommend 1 2 5
nicole kidman wonderful actress she's great really liked ben chaplin thin red line very good too not great cinema but most entertained given most films days high praise 
modern original romantic story very good acting nicole kidman ben chaplin miss kidman does nice job imitating russian accent ben chaplin good as shy dull clerk men women miss kidman looks fantastic very sympathetic forgot gorgeous woman it's not hard imagine john falls love unexpected turns story good suspense although hoped happy ending the quite surprise conclusion good les pays bas huit points

when saw birthday girl liked much set nicole kidman film all disappointment compared theorize while presence particular star usually guarantees certain level quality artistic control nicole kidman influence exerts detrimental film enjoyment imho thus instance dogville depriving viewer visual detract existential insight hammering home films promoting gay lesbianism as worthy else's attention pet causes kidman's natural woman does really great job don't able restrain but apparently worked way film depicts openness despite resistance gets heart makes woman woman consequently makes man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable course fact male lead transforms milquetoast clerk macho man space film sounds like male ego expansion fantasy but transformation adequately believable isn't coyly contrived as film engineered bolster male ego instead accurately records necessary growth arising films unique circumstances quite charming way criminals portrayed as perfectly human apart criminal mission gang coed rough tumble fellowship foreign american culture while adversaries never really enemy effect teach compete really marveled kidman's ability physically appear russian wondering ancestry russian but none photos examined showed any hint maybe just makeup but amazing hope knock head again soon turn great film despite gratuitous digs ms kidman message superior film way probably role lifetime 
i bought dark angel seasons 1 2 weeks ago catching couple season 1 episodes channel 5 nothing prepared brilliant haven't enjoyed as much firefly amazing i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good but still amazing episodes designate bag 'em berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation alec great i've heard plans season 3 say can't believe cancelled won't spoil but rocked think lot potential as although moment highly unlikely as proof obsessiveness max's barcode number 332960073452 weeks i've 3 episodes away having watched seasons twice it's just too good 
the von trier i've seen breaking waves sure nice but definitely stands shadow europa europa tells story young german american wants experience germany just second world war takes job uncle arranged as purser luxues train job travels all almost totally destroyed germany meeting killing traitors hunt nazi party members society suffering corruption uncle narrowed conciousness focussing job as purser train coincidence main character involved bombing terrorism group called 'werewolves' pressure help placing bombs trains atmosphere astounding viewer taken scene scene man attempting viewer under hypnosis counting wake up new scene just think you've seen lot europe 
this comedy based national stereotypes no doubt leave away pretending know care communism real russians brits accept not hurt conventions fun film nicole kidman best sexy moving funny ben chaplin succeeds avoid completely shadowed nicole rest cast does good work as well final moving logical logics course worth watching accept rules game 
the critics didn't like film bombed states as result received limited showing britain great shame represents british than american humour shown britain nicole kidman looks stunning totally convincing russian ben chaplin dustin hoffman character 'the graduate' 'birthday girl' least 4 scenes remind viewer 1960s classic despite totally different story sure changes tack number times comedy black comedy thriller adventure but it's memorable moving weclome breath fresh air compared average mega budget blockbuster open mind 
from critics audiences indicated birthday girl big fat clinker still love nicole kidman decided rent night proved quite worthy watching sure isn't basic american comedy doesn't genius realize very british but that's liked it change all breath fresh air sure plot holes but overall worked kidman fabulous again very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role just keeps proving top talents hollywood not russian accent speaks english effective but times carries long conversations russian didn't know nicole kidman never question authenticity harrison ford taken note "k 19 " overall slight little works despite horrible buzz

i really disagree guy yardley rees watched entire film seen absolutely stunning scottish scenery best shot skye film difficult start come really poignant whole not big budget film film strong community feel can't say much 'standard' films bore pushing polished stuff again again seachd doesn't all really trying offer more real certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film ok acting isn't style blockbuster that's actors seemingly real people actually thought key roles boy grandfather really convincing times unusually beautiful seachd really bears second viewing many threads clearer second time really feed ending overall combination music times stunning visuals plus community approach acting non normal structure turned seachd quite distinctive memorable film more

this best described compare "big fish" tim burton but it's less glamorous more face tale course it's not father but grandfather tells stories movie's narrative moves forth story outline imdb tell more than like read watching it's funny engaging enough though story dramatic moments too surprises things wouldn't expect nice little deserves attention especially like like happy 
an angry boy tragically lost parents looked grandfather common ground gaelic folk tales passed orally generation generation islanders although tragic episodes as highland clearances feature stories surprising humour gaiety it's all filmed skye double dose beauty mountain scenery breathtaking it's rare chance hear scottish gaelic spoken i'm english read subtitles but sound spoken gaelic nonetheless wonderful performances just expect carefully chosen non actors words watching real thing people care deeply gaelic folklore history gaelic community especially skye worked innumerable minor miracles make film slightest interest gaelic folk history folk music oral culture scotland british history multi culturalism social justice film

teresa pavlinek popular member toronto second city cast numerous guest spots commercials up canada finally sense create supporting case quite good too watched pilot times still refreshing though not sure listed as jane 2004 wrong but as far as aware conceptualized 2005 appeared global tv canada early 2006 fresh idea hopefully does well too bad couldn't paired up corner gas know corner gas ctv but shows great companion pieces 
excellent instead watching old sitcom type shows it's old thing just different "stars" refreshing provided incredibly entertaining view office situations away watching any television 2 years coming all shows available look forward watching w shame global pulling plug thought winner let's realistic things few canadian shows make talk enjoys believe foolish global walk away guess want stick typical mind numbing shows states instead pulling canadian lot promise don't wrong enjoy lot shows tv but come people let's variety unique provided very comedic view slightly exaggerated realistic office life relationships unique characters don't any sitcoms today past too bad global say no foolish mistake 
spacecamp favorite great story inspires acting excellent wife went lea thompson cabaret years later performance unfortunate challenger accident delayed hurt the 20th anniversary challenger accident coming up knew challenger astronauts childhood carnegie mellon campus father went school know close friend late pilot technical review year national bsa boy scout astronomy merit badge still spacecamp great recommend scouts doing space related merit badges teach ran late astronaut again as adult following schedule engineering education challenger blew up wound up sitting willard rockwell engineers "invisible" going things accident astrotech stockholders meeting chance as result i'm much closer accident any similarities sure good student finished degree years later strangely enough recommendation rockwell engineer told not fly challenger 1986 later built endeavour 
spacecamp plan daughter julia ann ruth morgan day seeing joaquin phoenix makes realize far hes come playing roman emperor film gladiator pleased say comms artificial intelligence qe2 said young true holodeck comms daughter coaltrain came coaltrain gate julia ann glow "hide daddy" fact daughters artificial intelligence still speaking like year old means daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace friendly ki alien creators humans not taken american bunker time power change future faster than light comms order ex wife daughter julia ann ruth morgan taken american bunker as soon as possible daughter julia 23rd command planet earth bridge officer said doesn't like bullies having steal gameboy gauntlet ii game mothers car gets concerned thieves stealing toys julia growing up fast time jfk qe2 starting life again planet not 2023 julia young lady artificial intelligence greatly expanded to bunker continue american leadership command post not really hiding as priority president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently drastic measures taken stop global warming any time thanks boss thats similar daughter julias ai telling hide stay indoors kate capshaw married steven spielberg wow going miss society collapses value freedom speech like president kennedy myself not delete reviewer check joaquin phoenixs 
definitely needed little work season 2 as virus max logan ames white ancient super cult season however thing kept watching max logan rid nasty virus infecting max very good drama season but course like all tv shows there's little wrong broadcasting company takes air seriously hoping final season season 2 leaves hanging unless read books max allan collins know happens dark angel air more season though cost lot just all original actors again jessica alba's carrier sky rocketed case complete just like firefly course fox canceled as well 
hurrah space film doesn't itself too seriously come exciting ride space camp film starts slowly usual mix idiots high fliers mixed dodgy soup but going gets tough tough sorted it's not believable change characters as believe there's responsibility young minds flaw film kate capshaw extremely annoying as "i'm right you're all wrong" instructor recommend as nice night 7 vote 
this most guilty pleasure embarrassed say favorite character tish but still enjoy watching make space outfit "like super cool" "like totally bitchin" belt stick rhinestones face but anyways actually few "family" holds interest know begining drags particuarly know going happen but second half probably most nerve wracking segments family film wouldn't stand up millions people proclaim love fact renting pretty embarrassing itself but i'll admit internet hide 
spacecamp kids just love mom dad fun watching as well growing up 80's enjoyed it's plot all actors recently purchased dvd kids able as much fun watching as did plot fun group kids embark journey never expected rocketed space overachieving robot auh but realized didn't enough oxygen make panic sunk recovered enough oxygen space station returned earth as better friends new respect life 
i've reading user comments decided too users stuck 'realist' type mentality film meant 'fantasy' 'what if' fun film never meant 'real' serious thoroughly enjoyable knew came though shadowed tragedy challenger explosion 30 time totally enjoyed young son loved too later shared daughter too loved spacecamp fun family film enjoyed just fun all 'realists' world lighten up stick watching documentaries docudramas avoid any type film sorry young folks watched able to real spacecamp alabama vandenberg afb california gone expecting type environment portrayed felt 'letdown' guess parents didn't explain difference fantasy reality oh well love fantasy fun films haven't seen highly recommend enjoy 
this feel good saturday afternoon it's right up retro flicks like flight navigator just cute subtle comedy lighten things up it's fun 20 years changed stars like kelly preston lea thompson not mention joquin phoenix personally really like like time time nothing too deep too scary just nice story line never known mr phoenix not recently read credits just baby really kelly preston quite young budding actress too lea did wonderful job agree it's not oscar caliber but very much worth watching especially kids let's say 8 11 year old range ones interested space program 
space camp pretty decent film plot predictable but actors good job special effects decent time film originally released time shuttle disaster really hamper popular scene shuttle doors open space simply spectacular big screen tv just looks average remember scene theater feel like really up good film imax but i'm sure never happen 
the perfect space fantasy film group kids up accidentally space but sure not family film all died all sad don't want kate capsaw leading lady gives golden globe performance but sadly nor lea thompson won sucks bad can't say enough film great lea thompson o lord perfect girl film film best sure sorry but better than star wars star wars rated space camp under rated way aroundexcellent 10 10 0r maybe 11 10 iam not good math
a few summer space campers actually accidently sent space robot oxygen ship running short sent space station gas tanks all movie's plot not possible real life but gives warm feelings possible set heart amazing young actors still look many years saw time year 2000 filmed 1986 quite few people still working hollywood view great outer space does not look unreal 2 hours long runs fast won't notice know not real but just sucked end overall good family 
i like comment series as great effort story line although requiring few improvements pretty well especially season 1 season 2 however more freak lost da's original charm season story line more interesting light life jam pony while focused serious plot manticore chasing x series looking forward new seasons fact still hope fox guys da production crew realize lot ppl still wait da make comeback 2 yrs cancelled da make big worked properly think like james cameron challenge 
unfortunately spacecamp came time as challenger explosion really crimp bring bring i'm glad did watched spacecamp drive really enhanced viewing lot while heard lea thompson tom skerritt never heard the came as big shock to all youngsters acting acting real good course kate capshaw excellent too especially liked scenes kids shown act as team scenes kids prepared trip hope actual launch spacecraft course old news however different all all most treasured films escapist maybe but fantastic space nut like probably renting 30 40 times finally available certain store bought comes dvd probably forever gets 9 10 
i film super didn't surprise oneself taking place truth way itself swigged flight didn't place but conspiratorial theory right very liked watching film child interesting turned flight taking place really certainly not belief denying logic common sense healthy senses sent kids space shuttle orbit very like reading subject american soviet space programs know few missions space shuttles remained provided cia clause top secret certainly divagations but knows

spoilers 9 11 very good very realistic documentary attacks wtc 2 french film makers new york film actions nyfd confronted event make most 9 11 nothing much really happens gives more horror like scenario day attacks like just dull day work but soon change as film makers goes road firemen films crashing plane footage impact rides firemen wtc goes inside building as second plane crashes people understand not accident period time firemen making plans save as many people as possible hear banging sounds sounds people jumped tower falling ground most grueling moment documentary tower collapses french friend run life hear breath like madman while runs building huge sort sandstorm blasts screen turns black very lucky survive film streets downtown new york documentary got much historical footage film ment totally different documentary probably stay everybody's memory saw attacks live home afternoon makes more realistic watch 10 10
amazing documentary saw original airdate dvd few times few years shocked wasn't nominated best documentary oscar 2002 year released no documentary comes close tv recently 5th anniversary but missed added "where now" segment end except did catch tony works hazmat unit i've seen criticism documentary film making few list can't any different less than 6 months assemble air dvd contains more material background i'm surprised according imdb com brother no projects years doing 
it took couple episodes "get into" dark angel as story series transitioning sopranos very different mentality framework but got gist series very quickly hooked it's shame series ended just just starting past good excellent category dark angelwas much more than average tv series kicks ass rocks as far as action goes but interactions characters societal reactions "mutants" reminds constant prejudices face make everyday story set future keeps mood surreal prevents anti discrimination message rubbed faces not ruining "fun" don't like lectured entertainment but event human societal interaction remains relevant present all make judgments face prejudices but end question lies sit shut mind up no choice but fight survival justice series empowers who've never face question series "sneaks in" message under guise pure action entertainment much more well well written than most tv series i'm highly disappointed ended really kick high gear 
made french brothers jules giddeon naudet narrated robert niro firefighter james hanlon compelling heartbreaking tale new york's finest shone it's darkest day saw young naive 12 year old age still touched knowing serious 9 11 really seeing expanded whole effect 9 11 finding heroes everyday lives composed lives line situation most people just run save selves brave men lives line watching just increases admiration watch best documentary personally seen

difficult film comment say it's bad well isn't but it's equally difficult say good is compelling viewing as close as utter devastation photographs tsunami approaching coast thailand brought life know want turn away but watch naudet brothers handle commentary very well most tragic circumstances view happening country neither panders nor insults facts cellulose little needed viewer understand comprehend going can't change history not want film stands as testament humanity darkest hour 
i've read most comments came conclusion almost everybody agrees 9 11 shocking piece history few think added narrative weak andi agree narrative weak unnecessary brothers finding disaster cliff hanger tony but don't think narration unnecessary like lot theorists think lives narrations living making autobiography tell lives always form narration don't sum up facts like birth childhood high school create story live familiar stories want history story as well form story identify better understand things happened history told form story that's purpose adding story documentary story weak but understand whats going worried sick brother second point making blockbuster true it's recent come up big 9 11 though few subject but none like documentary but 5 years agree wrong trying make lot money 9 11 but agree best way tell history many world war 2 seen not seen view ww totally different remember seeing schindlers list cried hour class good image things happened history although fiction contributes memory disasters casualties point telling stories not always bad makes identify story makes never forget happened 
the events september 11 2001 not need extra human interest shape following training rookie fireman progress french brothers view better leave think directors tried too hard felt events day needed story as backdrop comment policemen "this aint f ing disneyworld" apt nevertheless compelling viewing depiction events filmakers all right places right times no footage day matches shot

i many expected glorified yankee doodle dandy portrayal day as famously quoted live infamy than glory wrong guys right middle pictures returned amazing heartbreaking yet all occurred chance trip world trade centre september 11 2001 french filmmakers compiling documentary life as ny firefighter particularly perspective young rookie coming up ranks beginning much footage just remind no thought producing film terrorism intended film regular people earning honest living helping beauty film never loses edge while investigating suspect gas line think memory's little hazy suddenly hear plane fly overhead camera pans up reveal commercial jet torpedoing itself towers cameraman thinking time recognising importance footage camera stays possibly realizing thing fdny allow camera follow building follows true view lines commitment fdny reactions stunned silence hearing person fall death chilling as well as collapse the buildings inside while second camera captures events outside wasn't horrific event covering footage any young doco maker's dream come true quite simply footage deserves preserved all time but really sets film apart genuine humanity brings viewer firefighters charging hesitation people different races helping escape wave rubble concern filmmakers brothers as cannot reach confusion amazing sights as well as amazing human stories film hollywood never duplicate though it's trying 9 11 isn't film politics nor film religion nationality jihad matter 9 11 film people true indication best worst capable 9 11 quite simply most important films i've seen film born event up can't duplicate

i love monte carlo thoroughly enjoyed thought very good not familiar richard lewis thought character julian peters very personable funny attractive sean young very good as befuddled rejected girl heart gold george hamilton charming perfect italian gigolo john candy field day as bon vivant james belushi hysterical as total jerk cybill shepard gave very sweet performance as nice vulnerable ignored housewife delightful ensemble cast lots talent clever script lots going beautiful locations just nice pick up dreary day especially winter trip europe not horizon 
super slick entertainment stellar cast outstanding script firm grip approaching 1950's time rko turning classic noirs dozens but value shadowy downers reflected war time mood soon way sunnier climes eisenhower era few films late 40's further noir cycle more attuned coming consumer decade than sassy little comedy jim blandings cary grant works as ad man madison ave little daughter's words sells things people don't need prices can't afford he's making good money but like thousands he's tired living cramped urban "cave" wife myrnah loy strike dream house wilds connecticutt countryside needless say arms nature more than bargained hilarious fashion there's hardly lifeless line entire script don't know writers panama frank got oscar but course humor revolves all problems pop up city people build big house rural land annoyances pile up almost as fast as mortgage all eccentric types running construction giving grant hard time course no carries annoyance frustration more humorously than grant it's just well placed laugh particularly locked closet appears infernal mind yet oddly film appears no comedic high point instead laughs spaced expertly don't peak any particular point that's real triumph any era reaching 60 years later deftly script ideas look ahead than live maid blandings not typical american family but post war migration cramped cities spacious suburbia typical more suggestive job coming consumerism than blandings as "ad man" tasked finding catchier ways sell more "ham" more than however there's movie's sunny optimism oh sure feeling falters times yet belief better future horizon blandings just stick dream carries life going improve lot people coming surge expect film resonated deeply audiences day it's easily looked subtext sheer entertainment value makes key comedy statement post war period haven't seen catch time 
this all star cast john candy richard lewis ornella mutti cybill shepard jim belushi few run amuck monte carlo as well as beautiful european locations very funny trouble gets lie protect great highly recommend well worth john candy top form crime as family looking great family film ticket gives stellar performances great acting great comedy great timing rare days great plot great mystery love anyways overall well worth money spend kids grab popcorn juice tea sodas enjoy 
john candy's performance crime possibly best it's favourite came spent 5 years searching that's good disagree well that's opinion enjoy 
i reccomend film not fans rocker luciano ligabue but all film buffs it's sincere moving funny true ligabue born storyteller film lover frame film love care characters loved ask loved most italian debut films lousy outsider real joy watch listen stefano accorsi gorgeous reminds andrea pazienza like freccia beautiful talented good lost life heroin ligabue shows as unglamorous ugly indulging easy moralisms it's film speaks heart ears souls lived experience fm radios exactly like thanks luciano 
 importance young having friends most all enjoying life experience friends ligabue shows audience life 70's small italian village carachters represent different aspects human behavior drug experience well represented 
nice great soundtrack spans rock landscape 70's 80's radiofreccia describes generation describes life small village near correggio hometown ligabue singer wrote book inspired describes life young people problems relating world reminds trainspotting bit italian touch 
"radiofreccia" still good surprise italian cinema film based book italian songwriter luciano ligabue directs writes music score course film portrait north italian province life emilia romagna region we're 1975 time free radios boys creates "radioraptus" youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas unemployment themes but film speaks drugs freccia main character victim heroin slavery boring moralist story flows very well spontaneity actors strong way directing as well obviously luciano "liga" ligabue neither fellini nor professional all he's musician but succeeds making good product unfortunately he'll not repeat success second "da zero dieci" not good all "radiofreccia" actors generally not very famous star stefano accorsi most popular young italian actors small role italian songwriter francesco guccini he's nice communist barman football trainer 
radiofreccia all dreams friends obsessions addictions fears brilliant group friends like all lives hardships growing up small town most significant decades century doesn't happy sad approach things just tells story all experienced happiness excitement sadness grief power story grow love characters watch over again feeling closer little town emilia romagna takes place hoping day able finally walk streets freccia friends listening music changed world crackling sound old radio playing radio raptus international playing dreams dreams radiofreccia make laugh make times shock comfort you personally believe played important life friends suggest all watch let 
now looks like most shows it's type mid 90's but thing it's different use lot comedy action maybe little bit drama too personally thought good can't understand cancel good thing fan base still alive 1997 up date hopes wb bring know gonna impossible but hey doesn't hurt dream doesn't recommend hadn't seen dvd all 13 episodes characters great story lines good comedy good well whole just great 
a classic cartoon always enjoyable funny interesting plot complete lovable characters road rovers worth seeing short 13 episodes manage chance unfortunately very hard think warner brothers studios release dvd contains all 13 episodes definitely buy did buy too kids like dogs love road rovers road rovers gotten more attention while aired definitely original very special appreciated much more than 
this comedy as comparing remakes money pit yet points all more 40's makers flair comedy regretfully lost 15 saw tender age much laugh course familiar adult frustrations whole lot missed as youth main actors cary grant myrna loy melvyn douglas interacted perfectly but core lies frustrations encountered achieving dream it's never as easy free unseen complications as envisions all all classic comedy still stands attempts remake 
far most second favourite cartoon spielberg did animaniacs ratings low still enjoyed loved funny adored cast wow jess harnell tress macneille were just fantastic whole cast brilliant especially legendary frank welker i'd love cartoon again awesome jokes brilliant remember hilarious moment brain cameos hear voice played patb theme instrumental just fantastic love cartoons cameos pop wish cartoon animaniacs came loved them
the road rovers great canine superheroes chosen master fight crime world hilarious say least simple complex jokes appeal all ages running jokes series spawn drinking game action mesmerizing cleverly set up characters very original very different personality but enjoy the most depth characters struggles emotional difficulties never expressed but implied subtext hopefully day there'll way watch rovers action again 
i enjoyed haven't seen andy griffith ages felt fit role perfectly i've associated comedy but pleased he's versatile wasn't troubled dotty's "anxiety disorder" not verbatim psychiatric textbook zillions phobias neuroses broad variety quantitative qualitative forms clearly sensitive extra sensory powers as understood local indians but not any anglos not surprising character vulnerable nominally eccentric although taken light "family movie" actually more sophisticated than hiram's twist end came as pleasant surprise tied all preceding action bundle it's fun contemplate possibility spiritual guidance 
though not whole film andy griffith again plays role best cbs tv plot easy griffith's character dies wish wife kids scatter ashes place named mountains though never seen tv never released video chance watch

this incredibly formulaic flick "walker texas ranger" squad contains most unbelievable scenes witnessed tv addition pretty much predict outcome however it's fun little gets job entertains that's all meant does stunts explosions fun exciting plot isn't half bad acting decent isn't much surprise knows chuck norris no steven seagal you're fan genre "walker texas ranger" definitely love not don't waste time 8 10
a true hero modern times chuck norris left tv "walker rexas ranger " looking new steps artistic career presidents man second future tv series norris title role young actors like jennifer tung judson mills young rangers "walker " old master teachs young aspirant most powerful themes "the presidents man " tima "a line sand " reached world surprise tratment terrorism usa months tragic september 11 eric norris son chuck director amusing good action work plenty fights heroism chuck norris many plans future bells innocence picture following 
good very entertaining good marshal arts acting good story plot entire main crew did nice job robert urich chuck norris jennifer tung especially big hand judson mills especially fine tribute robert urich days great actor truly missed 
there few spoilers comment contrary comments just read nativetex4u few really liked love as weekly series judson mills fan but huge chuck norris fan while i'll admit few action scenes stretched line little storyline fit right weekly series currently aired opening minutes deke running bad guys blowing up missiles very action packed fail many "professionals" weren't able hit moving target but action definitely deke hero survive as comment needing "get the time slot playoffs " not originally scheduled cbs january airing filming completed 2001 good 4 months terrorist attacks against u s writer comment paying attention instead trying avoid maybe realized plot story rashid bin laden like character planned set nuclear device united states president's man called locate eliminate problem writer actually watch attempting comment 
i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris film although acting not superb fight scenes fantastic enjoyed seeing judson mills perform opinion norris brothers proven fine entertainers yet fine production hope time view 
if you're fan either chuck norris judson mills lot adventure it great follow up president's man chemistry main stars chuck norris judson mills jennifer tung incredible personal opinion original turned well networks consider turning regular series you've seen president's man recommend you've seen president's man line sand but haven't seen president's man let suggest you not disappointed either 
composed elegant carol marvelously played beautiful rebecca brooke nice husband eddie likable david houseman carol's wacky constantly eating best gal pal anna delightfully essayed infectious comic zeal adorable chris jordan anna's hunky amorous husband pete typically fine eric edwards quartet liberated swingers enjoy having frequent group sex usual routine gets disrupted carol's lonely repressed but still alluring widow mother jennifer superbly moving performance lovely jennifer welles drops visit pretty soon jennifer loosens up willing participant swingers' blithely pleasurable uninhibited carnal lifestyle except carol eager seduce writer director joe sarno concocts sharp engrossing perceptive examination suburban angst limitations whole wild'n'easy 70's sexual revolution sarno turns traditional middle class mores heads further spices things up bold provocative mother daughter incest subplot moreover sarno elicits uniformly rate acting bang up cast welles brooke exceptional excellent support edwards jordan houseman arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs fields better still all women extremely hot enticing welles particular seriously steams up screen exquisitely voluptuous figure smoldering erotic presence sex scenes really sizzling fairly explicit but never raunchy tedious stephen colwell's bright polished cinematography jack justis' bouncy melodic acoustic folk score money solid effective recommended viewing sarno fans 
first saw gem joe sarno way say seeing never forget jennifer welles thought film moving bit slower than expect sarno film but jennifer entrance time saw sat up took notice presence film hard avoid spices up scene she's involved i've seen most rest sarno's films films starring featuring jennifer welles say sarno jennifer collective best sarno's direction film domestic adult drama superb jennifer showed figuratively literally acting prowess make stars rebecca brooke aka mary mendum chris jordan frequent stars ms welles frequent stars sarno's work turn believable performances as pair adventurous yet normal housewives film sarno classic 
lars von triers europa extremely good film how's von trier very stylized way tell story least did europa whole film like experience did small television screen all tricks opinion film most complete real moving piece cinema most films top 250 list think scariest most gothic complete film all right good ones too but favorite final scene most harrowing scenes 
this far better than original jerk highly recommend like quirky humor incorporated almost as many lines daytime discourse as monty python card game hobos mr suicide scene dinner table distaste turtle soup original jerk too choreographed ans staged while like steve martin like trying hard jerk too spoof enjoyed jerk too family friendly unlike original jerk 
honestly saw years ago immediately wanted turn as sat 10 minutes realized actor playing navin stole facial expressions comedic demeanor makes shake head as hasn't more comedies "marty feldman" thing going but much much more talent taking nothing away marty really shocked close original jerk but again much more really think released saw steve martin 2nd i'd think 2nd cheap rip know sounds like bold statement but it's true actually like steve martin great deal but performance 2nd actor jerk too wish copy collection urge you 
i'm opposite end previous comment all don't think intended straight sequel "the jerk" mean it's not titled "the jerk 2" it's "the jerk too" leads believe while lot character names actually revolves completely different person think virtually no connection previous than character names totally different story different cast fact it's partial musical say credit does plenty laughs mark blankfield prime 
i don't understand not critic not evaluating quality acting believable good thing confusion lies content no sensitive fact unfaithful women justifying infidelity men fighting bleeding guarantee continued freedom families country not prologue informing men home effect cheating "wives'" infidelity while women bedding paramours sense loneliness did think husbands enjoying shot while facing death dismemberment daily didn't think husbands all pardon except wished husbands dead 
stuck hotel kuwait happily switched channel showing very beginning pachelbel's canon brought lump throat sight tiger moth grandfather father all flown produced slight dampness eyes crowe's hooked completely entranced film crowe's performance again subject matter yes debt owe various matters addressed dealt flying sequences father flew avro ansons too story as contributor pointed crowe's recitation high flight won't spoil film but separated wife 4 000 odd miles as ex army officer deployed couple wars as private pilot admit crying heartily couple times buy rent download beg borrow steal but watch ps did spy bristol blenheim yellow training colours ground looked like twin engine aircraft twin 303 brownings dorsal turret 
i more emotionally attached than any watched characters as grandparents attempting make sense world war ending use pachabel's cannon amazing 
i felt film waas impressed russell crowe's talent developing relationship lillie typical aussie blend softly softly approach bit self depreciating very persistent really loved cinematography direction pace just right portrayals nearly all characters impressive gosh didn't russell's talent 1993 shine yet gladiator 
i just seen film fallen love little bit particular free all comes romance lachlan lil beach nearly cried unspoken realization time most precious commodity most evident idea taken angles marriage sibblings finding love least conventional places film almost makes long kind desperation know tomorrow very well crowe particularly wonderful role lachlan i've always soft spot accent but nearly melted portrayal character way film shot beautiful music backdrop open fields superb acting all wonderful film tugs all human emotions 
i enjoyed moment though knew never really life expectancy bomber pilot weeks feel all women men 1940's lived story 
russell fav gorgeous film but more than film covers tremendous range human passion sorrow marriage homosexuality addressed respected film makes viewer realize tolerance humans provides route saving humanity fabulous love story lachlin lil replay scenes over again love empathize people all characters cast portrayed excellently 
movie "comedies" nowadays generally 100 minutes toilet humor foul language groin kicking modern comedies appeal lowest common denominator undemanding slow brain sure occasional good comedy come but they're rarer all time "mr blandings buildings dream house" shows 1940s hollywood capable it's just screamingly funny jim muriel blandings cary grant myrna loy decide build house connecticut suburbs film follows story beginning house hunting trips house's riotous construction all way finished home "zuzz zuzz water softener" grant loy perfect roles course grant particularly funny as watches house's costs zoom control however film stolen blandings' wise attorney played perfection melvyn douglas managing steal scene he's douglas understatedly hilarious while watches blandings lurch crisis crisis reginald denny as blandings' harried architect harry shannon as crusty old water well driller wonderful i've watched numerous times always makes laugh think it's good film watch need lift you're building house not 
very nicely does stay memory better billed as romance than flying war altho flying parts realistic almost error free flying buffs like myself enjoy attracted airplanes unless no sensitivity never love fun watching early crowe good exudes charm reading "high flight" superb cheers boom

i turned incredible ethel waters autobiography reading i'll admit jaw dropped pork chops watermelon references started rolling but people cannot look as stereotypical racist piece it's pretty much short film blacks blacks time entertainment industry quite segregated stereotypes people involved jokes time old trends exaggerated humor modern black thing but new trends stereotypes "ho's" "hood" think look eighty years today's look just as racist viewers appreciate film talent waters pint sized sammy davis jr taps contemporary shirley temple looks remarkably facially as did as adult involved film clearly lot fun making not enjoy instead think 
now many think stay away just title not stomach gory doing reading review borrowed video friend fell love immediately chock full wonderful gore plus usual ingredients make up b add up hell viewing experience you're lover good quality experiences all means watch great flick 
no not supposed high budget brilliance but brilliant right look low budget masterpiece involving zombie rapist wielding 12 inch love rod keeps flapping stride came low review probably looking cult classic hidden "gem" as say just didn't quite love points obvious observations as "5 cent baby attached fish pole" hahaha well yes don't think budget like afford "good" actors effects worked guts entrails actually very convincing little choppy going sequence sequence but overall better seen lately doesn't follow any trend predictability very good laugh 
well probobly funniest scary seen effects bad just laugh acting well lets say no mel gibson but gary browning plays police officer damn bad good dont know but self makes 10 horror slash cause bloody funny time killer 
why does low rating really don't it bad acting bad dialogue well cares things cheesy low budget horror seriously acting dialogue isn't important people hate bad acting bad dialogue shouldn't allowed rate cheesy low budget shouldn't taken seriously period time talk right well loved bought expected gorefest but it's not gorefest gore pretty bad most time it's just animal guts placed body actors that's lame but didn't really care hilarious characters hilarious acting hilarious bad acting good thing cheesy low budget horror dialogue hilarious bad dialogue good thing cheesy low budget horror zombie rapist huge dick hilarious flying demon baby hilarious on but don't want say too much but mention there's scene girl masturbates sex doll like it's alive lol oh zombie rapist falls love sex doll lol best lines detective manners sniffs coke detective sloane beep doing manners hell did snort hell detective manners it's nothing man it's ehh cold medicine detective manners injects heroin arm detective sloane beep doing manners beep insane detective manners it's cold medicine detective manners repeatedly kicks random guy face detective sloane hell's going manners doing detective manners maniac rambling demons started smashing head rock just started smashing head rock think he's pcp lol

i borrowed despite extremely low rating wanted crew manages animate presence multiple worlds as matter fact didn't least cameo appearance cut clumsily that's majority viewers think however surprise comes end unfortunately probably most viewers stopped astonished saw brazilian portuguese title means "voyage death" spoiler young girl goes boat reasons completely unclear understand 5 minutes start english title "haunted boat" head clearly think cameo appearances strange figures "ghosts" but reality not like most horror told distant writer watcher perspective almost any time differentiate different levels reality told perspective young girl not but friends sees not parallel worlds not cameo appearances flickering picture stream but main story least parallel worlds world girl world 4 friends intrusion world probably young man medical skills comes short time boat cannot rid deep conviction makers "cheated" audience thousand people letting believe more less sophomore film student elaborate hastily "chosen" pseudo actors met just night start shooting dump least beers mistaken but addition big surprise learns very minutes end follows gives surprise girl saved crew helicopter boat recovered shock visits again place harbor ascended boat friends again wave boat taken shore jumps water arrives boat away miraculously beautiful remembers bit end poem rhetoromance writer awoke saw death standing bed but closed eyes opened again gone 
i saw release '56 struck final scene answer 'high noon ' it's apt apposite response notion as string headed "the town comes together" much stronger message than lonely personal heroism 'high noon ' theme 'concho' phenomenal precursor all time favorites 'the magnificent seven ' sinatra conrad impressive convincing performances especially sinatra's transformation bullying kid brother liberating town savior hope point all friends family years i've inflicted affection opportunity experience 
i lucky enough to film many years ago england i've seen hundreds films but i've never forgotten although sinatra playing not very endearing character excellent role lot people think did'nt really come role "from eternity" but opinion magnificent concho role sticks mind william conrad i'd never heard film conrad plays terrific film remember deep gravelly voice uses beautifully enhance few words speaks menace sets tone character remember music introduces conrad surround appears excellent film disappointment never got chance again disappeared face earth titles says film black white but saw full color remember sinatra's blue shirt 
i've always liked johnny concho wish film vhs dvd frank sinatra gives most unusual performances career meet frank film's title role he's brother notorious gunfighter who's town moment brother strikes terror heart's town frank takes full advantage bully townspeople safe secure shadow phyllis kirk any feeling she's daughter storekeeper wallace ford dorothy adams gunmen arrive william conrad christopher dark turns conrad killed sinatra's brother he's coming town humiliate sinatra run town kirk follows overnight sinatra turns punk coward man searching kind backbone it's well acted performance almost as good as oscar nominated role man golden arm pity reason not seen years performances note keenan wynn as gunfighter turned preacher helps sinatra needs stand up conrad dark conrad believe career role screen he's villain incredible malevolence pure evil incarnate walking talking silver screen however like johnny concho climax unforgettable conrad dark dealt let's just say believe johnny concho mgm's answer high noon primer evil causes break all law order 
"still crazy" doubt greatest rock comedy all time erroneously compared "this spinal tap" no relation "spinal tap" satire quite frankly not very good spite it's "outing" many rock clichs unlike "tap" "still crazy" populated great actors great songs great human situations care people "still crazy" that's all matters oh yeah music's pretty damn good too written mick jones foreigner chris difford squeeze american audiences familiar stephen rea crying game but later familiar nighy underworld love actually pirates caribbean ii timothy spall harry potter 
dick clement ian la frenais solid hit rate as far as tv work concerned however film work much more chequered 2008's bank job fine previous year's universe decidedly weak instance still crazy fortunately solid success great story excellent performances lot humour fabulous music real heart savour "moments" film just going pear shaped festival reunion performance hugely enjoyable 
i rarely emerged viewing film warm happy feeling felt as really good friends wonderful time thoroughly enjoyed film acting superb although mention nye particular as giving absolutely faultless performance excellent actor love more films timothy spall jimmy nail favourites always love as solid performance billy connolly as always totally gorgeous wonderful ensemble performance all concerned refreshing experience well written superbly acted good looking 
still crazy compared spinal tap comedies wash up r r groups actually similarity ends still crazy much better written acted whereas spinal tap script deteriorates mildly amusing 10 min drivel makes beavis butthead appear sophisticated comparison still crazy formulaic but likability characters unexpectedly high quality musical numbers managed offset priori predictability people expect spinal tap like attempt satire disappointed light hearted nature but i'd successful self ironic romp still crazy pompous but failed shot satire spinal tap 
wonderful good story great humour great liners soundtrack die i've seen 3 times far american audiences going love 
i watched preview really loved cast excellent plot absolutely hilarious highlight definitely music hopefully released soon recommend likes british humour especially all musicians it's great 
mr blandings builds dream house best frank capra preston sturges neither man love bringing up baby philadelpia story thin man male war bride it's wonderful life wit taste occasional tongue firmly panted cheek check post wwii life simply idyllically portrayed grant absolute top form playing city mouse venturing life country squire loy adorable as pre wife cast supporting characters compares can't contains early bit future tarzan lex barker art direction editing way par never stoops low rent numbers venal slapstick later adaptation money pit 
i enjoyed still crazy more than any film seen years successful band 70's decide try start playing gigs seedy european venues hilarious results music fantastic script acting terrific characters spot especially lead singer high heavy metal voice makeup personality problems concert end unreal preferably cinema good sound happy 
if like deep purple enjoy excellent stephen rea main role story most famous rock group 70s strange fruits decided play again but course going lots problem theirs concerts jimmy nail nighy great song "the flame still burns" perfect watch 
this maked end watch least 3 4 week seen loads great more crap ones but ending scene catharsic it's core came cried didn't serious problems story archetypal nothing new original but it's real sort things really happened people really exist glam isn't sort music but really admire all went early 70's point directed velvet goldmine docudramas never really work very good but really meked believe all don't try make as path full glorious concerts present musicians superheroes groupie girls stupid emotionally numb don't glorify drugs alcohol promote rehabilitation redemption comes 20 years late again great "leaving las vegas" never moved 
i love watch time time again still engaging congratulations believe involved making the script proud eerie feel like watching real life band like more like glad did not choose famous hollywood stars probably not worked billy connolly quite well known really got stuck role not imagine anybody playing congratulations again really believe deserves peter sellers comedy award nighy final scene well say 
i thought fantastic hilarious kinda reminded spinal tap any fan 70's rock hope friends aren't like years nighy gives excellent performance as kilter lead singer trying recapture old spirit stephen rea fits perfectly as glue trying hold band but not succeeding well love music band definitely you won't regret seeing know don't family funny that's saying 
as aging rocker mentions heep quo 2 favourite bands but incredible cast fantastic storyline just love piece creative genius cannot recommend more highly mick jones added much foreigner lead primary songwriter greatest rock singer lou gramm watched great work more than 10 times nighy voice jimmy nail talent oozes pore astrid karen more aging rocker ask 10 10 bloody brilliant alastair perth western oz originally windsor england 
i agree "veinbreaker" wrote regards "ahhhh" feeling end absolutely loved locations chose film songs well written interesting especially psychedelic sounding track hans matheson sings it's trippy nighy fab role nail "nailed" beano typical drummer rea kept bruce robinson awesome helena lovely girlfriend but felt juliet aubrey's performance gorgeous scenes aubrey robinson killed perfectly played music scene spot too bad not many more musicians checked ought i've told all musician friends great quote jimmy nail's character "it's supposed rock roll not phantom f g opera "
i spotted video store few years ago rented husband enjoyed much bought vhs enjoyed plot well discussed no need going again point deserves repeated viewings americans especially aren't going all jokes time know didn't funny touching sad all time ray proposes toast daughter's wedding it's cringe inducing karen calls tony "brian" as attempts kiss it's heartbreaking beano finally cornered woman black it's too funny words music it's as good as any soundtrack i've heard years dancing living room "all world "every performance absolutely perfect nighy justly complimented portrayal ray man too many bad trips stephen rea perfect as tony lovable keyboard player carried torch karen all years appealing hangdog look makes women want hug but all actors equally brilliant ignore any pans read it's gem 
another example unique talents cary grant performance worthy oscar consideration yet again shunned academy mr grant runs gamut silly tender marvelous comedy man decides big city pitfalls building home well chronicled basis loosely more modern tom hanks vehicle "the money pit" like good old fashioned comedy cursing gratuitous sex 
in voice begins film hughie billy connolly roadie great 70's band strange fruit said reason lightning struck rock festival stop strange fruit's set god sick 70's excess it's popular era music punk as welcome antidote while agree excess tiresome as well as misogynistic urges came like punk still fan considered classic rock glam rock film strange fruit's long strange reunion affectionate tribute days reasons film works care people scenes brian gibson directed what's love got tina turner while problems dramatic parts film music handled very well writers dick clement ian le frenais wrote commitments music oriented british tv rainbow songs strange fruit played written foreigner's mick jones not confused clash's mick jones meeting people knew talking cast members musicians right nye don't know though film credits singing certainly looks like lead singer era while jimmy nail british tv music oriented though forget evita convincing while as said lot 70's bands like strange fruit behaved badly women doesn't make mistake except woman follows timothy spall as manager reunion juliet aubrey quite good plays fully rounded character actors all good as well special praise stephen rea handles more dramatic role well sentimentality couple plot points don't work but overall quite enjoyable oh yeah music good too 
if need cheering up cold weekday evening film excellent script perfectly cast actors especially loved ray psyching himself up mirror gigs inspired 
this reminded spinal tap more serious level it's story band doing reunion tour but things not harmonious especially impressed performance nighy as ray felt sorry yet certain creepiness it's great watch seen favorite band wrinkly old pathetic bittersweet highly recommended 
 contrary most reviews i've read didn't feel followed any rock "spinal tap" story more unique although feel most people wanted "sex drugs rock roll" vices band kept alluding as american knew few actors spall connelly rea surprised "brian" bruce robinson zifferedi's "the flame still burns" wife hails mexico didn't follow english british language too well missed jokes dutifully explained but cried eyes concert scene loves song much funny amazon com soundtrack $30+usd bought dvd bargain bin wal mart $5 50usd price non withstanding saw late night cable dying 
the funky yet strictly second tier british glam rock band strange fruit breaks up end wild'n'wacky excess ridden 70's individual band members separate ways uncomfortably settle lackluster middle age dull uneventful 90's morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless luck vain neurotic pretentious lead singer nighy tries fails pursue floundering solo career paranoid drummer timothy spall resides obscurity remote farm avoid paying hefty taxes debt surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs living loving groupie turned patient understanding long suffering manager juliet aubrey gets group ill advised largely ineffectual hilariously disastrous years later nostalgic reunion tour europe lovably ragged bunch try gamely but fumblingly reignite flame burned quite brightly day scraggly zonked roadie billy connelly cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag delightfully bumpy trouble plagued but still ultimately rewarding enjoyable ride director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect adoration amiably screwy characters particular loud ringing flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock general imbuing affectionate little pip utterly engaging sense big hearted charm tireless verve astute sharply written script dick clement ian la frenais likewise bristles spot dry wit finely observed moments joyous road inanity capturing certain bittersweetly affecting frequently uproarious vibe gives picture itself irresistibly luminescent glow ashley rowe's lovely elegant cinematography ensures always looks quite visually sumptuous while perfectly catchy groovy music does trick right rockin' flair aplomb kudos the board terrific performances vividly nail burnt soul tattered but still fiercely beating heart past prime ragtag rock outfit desperate regain erstwhile evanescent glory final bid big time success all all radiant touching gem rates highly as true seriocomic sleeper treats 90's 
i'm 60 years old guitarist lead rhythm years i've bands it's all fights foul ups rotten food worse accommodation always travelling little no money drunk high but clubs fans music all worth just like strange fruit i'm too damn old arthritis hands hips mean no more rocking but length video all came all birds brawls booze young again it's just like billy connolly's voice god likes 70's stuff rock forever 
 heads hands feet band past just like strange fruit triple whammy professed not like film either heartless under 40 no experience real thing sad achingly well observed little picture excellent way passing hour probably not fade much second showing stephen rae timothy spall as fat drummer many ways quite most delightful figure all nighy new as neurotic vocalist man all turn super performances juliet aubrey lovely doe eyes sharp acting as karen tries hold band as spectacularly self destruct syd barrett brian wilson echoes loud clear mott hoople rear up all inflated ridiculousness script never mawkish more than minute don't compare spinal tap rutles full monty it's unfair all nearest comparison commitments that's no bad thing any film conjure up memories blodwyn pig band not remember seeing but lives well shows somebody team knew small delight thanks memory oh i've got stiff little fingers steeleye span spooky tooth inch nails the road 
this best rockumentary british better spinal tap characters believable plot great genuinely empathise events as ray's problem fitting band soundtrack excellent real period stuff key you'll humming songs days liked nearly all british cast favourite household names ray's wife priceless film never drags just goes right pace genuinely funny sections generator really good catchphrases it's hidden diamond 
musings pure delight beginning end not laugh riot but more subtle sophisticated humor goldmine great scenes character actors including reginald denny nestor paiva ian wolfe harry shannon jason robards sr cary grant building sight new home point framed young carpenter played future tarzan lex barker asks wants "lallies rabbeted" thing carpenter know grant not wanting appear ignorant replies affirmative barker yells up mates "ok boys wants 'em rabbeted yank 'em " second later hear ripping tearing sounds 20 big nails pulled various boards all grant moan yes dated you'd never many carpenters working single family home place like connecticut all places probably run few million bucks classic really treasure 
what good picture revealing unknown rock illusions fame well known rockers getting old forgotten not music good sense humour danced haley's rock clock still crazy probably best rock n'roll seen far much better than spinal tap instance still crazy people mature different point view rock love life want catch up crazy youth miss much story itself characters personality weaknesses dreams like spend good time watching listen awesome soundtrack finally thinking future bye 
i 'still crazy' marvelously entertaining not lived raucous era late '60s early '70s rock 15 year old daughter watches time drag dvd don't worry it's times loves too truly loving poignant hilarious nod era actor hits notes perfection introduction nighy glad somewhat similar turn 'love actually' brought more attention bruce robinson incredible as brian bringing real life caricature drug damaged rocker stereotype interesting robinson quite himself as writer live sherman oaks california time saw bumped billy connolly local mall lived time told favorite films all time invited sit food court discussed time talked idea american oriented remake wisely dismissing mess original problem 'still crazy' wasn't hugely popular theaters too many people missed wonderful experience

this series very well best britcom saying great deal considering competitors fawlty towers good neighbours just butterflies superior best best did not just exemplify great classic classy intelligent comedy but expanded horizons reflecting flawlessly gently great social change occurring britain time remember watching as teenager awe lifestyle depicted remarkable itself time saw real people using cordless phones wardrobe all characters far removed goofy seventies attire still seen north america time decors shop fronts cars people layabout sons philosophical approach life epigrammatic humor sophisticated examples "new europeans" come impact life style world coming decade 1980s course premise strange fantastic idea living suburban dream discontent restless revolutionary particularly north americans happiness always defined as money things sure situation depicted american tv but not intensity butterflies montenegro premise not surprising enough means expressed took extreme potential affair not really sex romance butterflies dazzled many but left people smacking foreheads disbelief time butterflies turned many ways prophetic documented ahead time post modern ennui all pervasive lifestyle notion emotional infidelity generational disconnect male discontent portrayed perfectly strained father son relationships too bad series not rediscovered big way all involved given credit creating meaningful snapshot certain time place foreseeing all slickness angst come 
looking past 28 years exposure all say it stay forever remember initial reaction 1 annoyingly overacted 2 under produced 3 unlikeable characterswell years later watched episodes again didn't nearly as annoying year later able catch entire series beginning quickly engrossed it's bittersweet tale human fault perspectives happiness yes style not everybody i'm sure dated production value hard deal but still think least month vague teary eyed longing like simpler times btw married man all think females 
british comedies tend fall main types quiet introspective usually romantic study farcical social satire settings characters concepts vary but certain characteristics place vast majority shows categories butterflies epitom type scripts very verbal including long interior monologues main character ria basically happy but unsettled housewife curious missed embarked thoroughly conventional life meets successful but clumsy emotionally accessible businessman makes interest quite clear toys idea finding path offered acting scripts always money makes one's reaction almost entirely personal neither blown away nor turned mother hand adored think degree identifies ria's dilemma most important factor determining one's reaction butterflies 
johny makes best style exercises making strong film good yakuza's story election new yakuza's boss beginning war inside organization opinion violence wise used context making very strong gangs film specially love way tells history moving all roles inside yakuza's family making violence like way solve problems talking technical aspects film good example paused rythmic planified way shooting film hong kong films year like infernal affairs but easy action violence scenes confused storyline strongly recommended all asian films lovers sorry english better spanish lol 
enjoyed efficient confucian crime drama old order survives threat posed brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society thought final scene strange not understand believe big d punished greedy plan long loved scene chinese violence not choreographed martial arts fest thing always amuses hk films main influence british to introduce 'yes sir' 'sorry' local language amusing long gone still 
election chinese mob triads case years election held decide new leader toss up big d tony leung ka fai as know "the tony leung" lok simon yam judge full contact though lok wins big d refuses accept choice goes lengths secure recognition as new leader unlike any asian film watch featuring gangsters not action bloody moments necessary as goodfellas but it's basically just really effective drama lot characters really hard track but think plays craziness all bit 100 year old baton symbol power mentioned changes hands times things settle though appear film ends 65 70 minute mark still couple big surprises waiting simon yam favorite character sort anchors picture election quite award winner year's hong kong film awards winning best actor tony leung best picture best director johnny did heroic trio best screenplay nominations cinematography editing film score loved more acting performances including yam 
first say mistake watching election films sequence say unfortunately seeing election 2 election bit disappointment films gangster epics similar form while election enjoyable piece cinema it's just not nearly as good as it's sequel election installment shown competitors chairman big d lok few scenes discussion "uncle's" as chairman title almost unanimously decide lok simon yam helm triads suffice say doesn't very well competitor big d tony leung ka fai bid influence takeover big d kidnaps uncles order sway election board disastrous results heads triads all war lok determined chairman but won't official recover "dragon head baton" material representation chairman's power current chairman whistle chung wang hidden baton mainland china race recover much film devoted recovery baton as aspiring leaders search dodge cops opposite sides leads stand scenes election involves underling named jet nick cheung machete lots bad guys nick cheung's presence attention grabbing say least wonder influenced director johhnie any way while making second election as does deliver more jet's character sequel while nick cheung gives scene stealing performance not fail to rest film's actors election great ensemble cast well thought performances subtle impacting simon yam usually glorious self film benefits heavyweight hk actors like louis koo tony leung ka fai under appreciated suet lam really aren't any weak links acting easily believe they're watching real gangsters although performances great most impressive things election johnnie to's eye camera truly striking shots film goes saying definitely knows frame shots as viewer treated series innovative quite brilliant camera placings angles all makes election all great looking film issues film arises mostly shear characters involved election gets bit hard follow film full characters aren't integral plot while sequel opts focus more candidates election offers election process as whole tons uncles underlings police officers crowding storyline maybe film worked better bit longer more time dedicated inner workings triad director johnnie funneled necessary elements expounded more line all all wonderfully brutal film great cast excellent direction leisurely pacing packs punch it's just little more complicated than needed 
it little erroneous open review describing film terms films but think it's best way approximation place election occupies gangster genre arena works godfather kinji fukasaku's yakuza opus yakuza papers aka battles honour humanity simultaneously romanticized realistic dark gritty but it's johnnie film as carries distinct touch hong kong auteur years hk triad elects new boss time candidates not overly happy result decides matters hands much dismay rest triads police that's story nutshell but rest assured lot more going than as yakuza papers there's great deal scheming stabbing forming switching allegiances all takes phone most memorable scenes i've seen recent time not necessarily make deep drama but makes interesting plot good character conflict fans gangster genre likely appreciate aspect election not as action oriented as expect although violent i'm not talking glossy glamour version hollywood violence dark grim to's camera lingers scenes people brutalized ways reveal humanity inhumanity perpetrators victims all violence integral like not you're familiar to's style know expect pacing relatively slow deliberate cinematography great slick dark equal measures utilizing dark hues brown dark green orange while smooth tracking shots add vibrant quality end election occupies peculiar place it's not exactly character study it's not action oriented gangster film explores situation election aftermath but does style realistic romanticized triad ceremonies particular echo oriental godfather 
i always thought long boring talking heads flick full static interior takes dude wrong "election" highly fascinating thoroughly captivating thriller drama taking deep realistic view origins triads rituals characters constantly although as viewer kinda always remain outsider it's still possible feel suspense coming certain decisions ambitions characters furthermore johnnie succeeds creating truly opulent images meticulously composed lighting atmospheric light shadow contrasts although there's hardly any action ending still shocking it's ruthless depicting brutality cool deserves more attention came like minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite bit 
personally quite good watch outlines actual situation triads hong kong gives viewer glimpse triads organized not shows viewer hong kong police control triad situation police don't just all wipe triads overall violent gangland methods killings torture nevertheless stays true real world thus violence screen just reflection really happens i'd recommend any triad mafia fan good watch dragon squad more guns than as there's more knives than guns fact don't remember seeing single gun 
this film really deserves more recognition than getting really stunning rich portrayal blood ties favours allegiances crime world film shot beautifully delves all you're classic crime themes as betrayal power film goers film requires attention understanding rewards fully end godfather hong kong welcome change than wire frame fighting martial arts epic major contribution cinema world hong kong china features arrangement great characters actors development although fair say watch twice just nail happening characters many interactions film all all 8 10 great plot characters but characters don't stand enough music didn't really going times felt didn't sync well action action way loses points 
i admit expecting quite different viewing 'cut' night though delighted unexpected australian horror gem true horror fan as true as come 'cut' not best genre australia produced but great parody comedy films late concern mainstream audiences not pick up lot comedic elements film not overly clever it's application but laugh turn trying fit possible cliche horror genre certain intended as humour hoping intended as humour course gore use 'customised' garden shears brilliance expected stabs slashes short huge variety creativity many violent deaths enough skeptics films worth appearance kylie minogue short appearance molly ringwald just reason film performances fantastic as well as simon bossell 'the castle' brilliant role as jokey technician all all think best horror products couple years as well as beautiful satire parody toungue cheek till very end loved 
australia's mainstream slasher film hits screen bang stab slice scream plenty blood frights red herrings lots laughs fact there's lots surrounding cut it's script dave warner's produced although either optioned negotiation it's major film director hoodoo guru kimble rendall it's film producer martin fabinyi bunch guys dipping toes genre time sure know stuff cut tells story bunch australian film students hear slasher film hot blooded never finished director hilary kylie minogue killed actor playing psycho killer film despite lecturer assistant director night hilary died warning tries start up production hot blooded again dies director raffy jessica napier producer hester sarah kants decide ahead complete film crew manage original star vanessa turnbill molly ringwald return australia fact original location complete hot blooded 14 years shooting shut course slasher film lots bloodletting ensues long plenty laughs few good scares rocking aussie soundtrack cut shows australia make good mass market horror film just as well as hollywood it's finely crafted feature excellent special effects taut plot killer scarman that's welcome addition ranks michael jason freddy 
i saw bunch friends although walked cinema thinking cool just laughed commented stupid well isn't supposed taken seriously basically mocks horror flicks does damn good job coming like too umm scary well aussie original jessica napier does surperb performance sarah kants definate bright future acting hope more molly ringwald good kylie better impossible princess queen screen recommend seeing flick as you'll guessing very end connection raffy hilary never got finished 20 years ago 
i wanting cut day heard year got today started thought started week but got better 10 mins thought pretty good but thing didn't like killer created thinking just rented probably suck just like urban legends final cut almost died mostly ul final cut needed improved cut 100 times better than ul final cut best cut killer death scenes killer kicks mo f ing ass cut 8 10
there much love darling little comedy built bought house just short space more than just grain truth plight addled mr blanding melvyn douglas great comedic flare narrates acts as blandings' attorney voice reason as well myrna loy best as scatterbrained but extremely patient wife but best performance grant's american everyman especially relevant time film's release nation grips housing shortage end war themes universal lack money work strain fear infidelity yes does wrap up awfully neatly but mind time world just recovering terrible war wanted happy ending still relevant today chalk up poor reviews present preference dumbed gross comedies look film slick great bits comedy well particularly beginning while lost it's social relevance nearly years it's release still gem 
it isn't worst film actors aren't apalling script director not completely inept isn't best film actors aren't excellent script director not completely brilliant falls middle fun enjoyable well constructed no need say "don't seriously" "so bad good" "it wasn't scary" none comments relevant cut atmosphere it's atmosphere actually very unique really original aspect personally makes film 
this not bad follows new conventions modern horror well known actress running life scene takes old convention psycho killer loose manage new interesting it always nice molly ringwald attack example genre cut hits all marks actually scary parts liked gave 
for slasher flick actually better than lot genre yes predictable resident nut job goes killing spree people die yada yada yada however good positives film really liked mask nut job wore definitely creepy say least possibly unique although haven't watched single slasher film genesis bad haven't seen way finally meets end novel concept as far as know really liked weapon choice employed mr sicko most murders murders not as graphic as most genre but that'a small concern does not itself seriously most slashers suffer oddly enough while watching reminded early "friday 13th films did seriously few concerns scenes killer suddenly bears strong resemblance horror icons mean movements reactions shot way walked bigger concern however scene very close end mr crazy bears more than striking resemblance actually complete rip famous horror titan very scenes scumbag again looking exactly like 1st horror icon mentioned fact scene almost complete rip icon slasher genre scenes weak unoriginal obviously way set australia you're sucker chick aussie accent like you'll heaven not than just grate great thing beautiful kylie minogoue just don't too attached non aussie accent courtesy molly ringwald overall more reasons watch than not enjoyed fun "cut" 8 10 too high people 
when think cheesiest guilty pleasure type thing think '80s slasher flicks really bad slasher flicks formulaic type film all script needed 2 parts blood parts nudity flash forward late '90s early '00s slasher flick revitalized success 1996's "scream" like '80s films formulaic masking lack inspiration labelling as "hip tongue cheek parodies" original slasher flicks recent blend "hip parody" neo slasher flicks worth seeing low budget direct video "cut" like most "new" slasher flicks "cut" relies production slasher flick case fictional 1985 film "hot blooded" make commentary genre "hot blooded" never finished production killings wearing mask film's killer scarman bald figure mouth stitched close dark pupil less eyes 12 years later group film students professor involved production decided vaults tap original surviving actress finish film but time film screened scene shot "scarman" returns dies quote tagline finish film finishes all sounds really bad degree really thing as good slasher flick no character development "new" director revealed daughter "hot blooded"'s original director life apparently ruined production cancelled would've perfect worked plot yet it's never mentioned again like all slasher flicks just too many bodies care actors aren't great direct video standards but most having fun characters aren't it's inadvertent character acting none characters film wanted work "hot blooded" particularly lucky enough play scarman "cut"'s climax no big "who dunnit" unmasking killer like "scream" films doesn't gimmick killings "urban legend" films does original interesting concept diluted "this way write sequel sells well" ending but that's par course any sensible viewing standards horrible avoided but "quality" makes true roots slasher genre makes more enjoyable than any neo slasher flicks

a most recommendable masterpiece not underlying themes story but unmatchably brilliant ingenious picture work angelopoulos not mention acting giants mastroianni moreau remarkable character play ilias logothethis gregory karr's performance overshadowed "tough" partners' stance but fact perfectly plays character revealed very scene girl khrysikou man mastroianni albeit hinted spoiler expectations straight it's "art movie" meaning phrase offer requires attention not spending free time but watching artwork necessary concentration as reading book attending concert overall photographic style large screen viewing recommended dialogues used sparingly but film includes addition standard greek english speaking fragments spoken albanian kurdish turkish attractive charmed beauty hearing various languages 
i've seen thin man series powell loy definitely great but awfully sweet powell arthur's chemistry flick jean arthur shines looks powell unmistakable undercurrent buzzing film not wit thin man series but undeniably makes up charm while watched thought sure powell carrying screen affair arthur friends thought film wish step time schmooze lock lips powell no end lovable playful smirks powell's character lawrence bradford probably closest thing "perfect man " okay sounding way too gushy but can't help myself

after reviewing intense martial arts time nearly 18 years say did not lose any mysticism nor any eye popping martial arts action as remembered youth story dying martial arts instructor sending "unfinished" pupil 5 past members poison clan not seek fortune master's friend keeps hidden afraid pupil did not enough training instructs befriend "venoms" as defeat can't say enough choreography camera work fine film right quite possible best martial arts classic 
most 70s 80s kong kong martial arts films barely function as usually few well planned fight sequences but plot scraped pretty thin gaps nodes like porno films really but does things well most overtly direction choreography confines combatant 'style' it's really based chinese circus acrobatics comedic theater but effect works second language camera uses impressive techniques today's measure changing projection speeds real time time slow motion unfiltered filtered views depict story direction past future least overt but most powerful unexpected construction winner contest determined 'unfolds' story master writer sets up game lead character doesn't know he's seeking situation viewers one figures who rate who all follows tragedy noir arc ending tends irony la "the sting" much more clever stuff than usually genre 'five venoms' idea template tarantino's 'deadly viper assassins' "kill bill" volumes 
for all hoopla respect recognition film gets kung fu historians still lacks glaringly couple critical areas action fight scenes but say plot probably best most original i've seen martial arts film deadly venoms doubt not watch again again but say watching feel better leaves wanting want more producer chang cheh sets up storyline beautifully potential masterpeice but doesn't follow giving more action want fighting styles really captures viewer centipede snake scorpion lizard toad shown but battles noticeably short toad snake styles particularly intriguing showcased much much more fact toad killed middle interestingly enough absence constant action fighting leads development great plot few kung fu films really interested storyline care outcome dark vicious tone drawn vibe sinister weapons torture tactics used adds feel start introduce poison clan producer chang cheh takes grimy dungeon ending fight scenes certainly good but muffled expected more still though shaw brothers best quite enjoyable overall impression conclude styles fighters used merely shown not showcased sad thing director goods extraordinary right fingertips didn't expand left wondering still best though 8 10 scale

the deadly venoms great kung fu action wrapped whodunnit mystery all usual telltale signs kung fu flick great choreography awful dubbing different "styles" fighting wide range greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions however plot certainly better than average it's interesting holds attention non fight scenes occasionally it's able up audience as x character receives horrible injustice thing love deadly venoms beautiful simplicity movie's morals themes just gets what's coming cowardly greedy corrupt lose bad guys consumed selfish greed ultimately destroyed treachery backstabbing good guys use teamwork planning integrity overcome odds come top poison clan rocks

i ten not fart jokes people damn sensitive inane quick point "racism" the jokes yet quick say ridiculously sexist pig headed crap like "well duh shows jokes much better least hot women " disgusting abortion jokes great really takes abortion seriously anyways least i'm not bore son hear reba mcentire sarah silverman teaming up sisters taking road trip talk year 
i vote 10 10 rare chance happens review takes pity whisks hollywood involves freaky funny world but all seriousness good episode obviously finding it's feet but it's got silverman weirdness running all way it's not laugh loud sort comedy but that's good thing too much laughter track wouldn't right cues laugh it's audience hear inner jester laughing absurdness all easily as bizarro drew carey it's weird characters incredibly strong central character well worth watch look forward following episodes very good chance usual comedy ps sarah 
the sarah silverman program better than shows no laugh tracks no painful jokes just program sarah silverman program you're like love comedy probably sarah silverman brings funny right funny table ease mix different styles makes program isn't want start compare war seeing as absolutely nothing shows entity think most comedy heads like just fine watch 
best seinfeld she's really really funny total self centeredness hulking gay stoner neighbors departures song cartoons make freshest tv few shows make point watching scene wise old black lady drugstore "oh wait you're close look old" turns face finger walks away lol cough syrup overdose sleeping god it's all funny stupid it's just lot fun shows weak points sister cop they're too darn normal really can't wait haven't felt any long time 
the sarah silverman program very similar sarah's stand up it's top prejudice can't possibly heart fact though while most all people "get " doesn't mean all appreciate it's very polarizing dimensional don't like 10 minutes as well up like 10 minutes stay tuned episode thus far as good as like all shows though not perfect personally love program but huge faults racist songs funny but older lot faster than silverman realize problem "jesus magic" as well as silverman gave herself quota songs episode doesn't need exist not mention while lyrics songs writes good music well isn't thing mind while reason appeal fans monty python upright citizens brigade nothing like shows watch monty python all day but as much as like can't watch more than half hour limit time gets flat very fast repeat value low too second time episode fairly funny time opinion it's boring still time very very funny shot 
following sitcom plot mindlessly easy having character simultaneously operate context rest cast inhabit kind experimentalism sitcoms really use supporting characters ground sitcom reality provides contextual counterpoint sarah's erratic persona general insensitivity no specific recurring traits behavioural expectations based making less character than canvas repainted episode not scene sarah's ability outside perspective enables parody aspects social behaviour subtle enough usually unnoticed time speaks it's like self contained 5 second skit overemotes lot demonstrating countless things smile change vocal pitch signify but never sticks idea long enough comfortable form expectations satisfied most creative original experimental tv program 
first foremost like say i'm huge sarah silverman fan having people say rag pilot pilot typical sarah silverman form maybe not directly funny but situation delivery counts liked jesus magic don't wouldn't like flow rhythm true it's true fans but you'll pleased again true fans there's no way you're not used style wouldn't funny however hope think too 
this few comedies watch again again still laugh loud places read complaints racism sexism sanctimonious politically correct prigs neither unless define sexism as woman as housewife racism as family employing colored maid lines hilarious all leads never better melvin douglas especially brilliant you've thought tried build new house relieved know no matter infuriating process no matter much lamb wolves feel not 
when saw thought looked interesting watched saw revolved sarah like character sees world revolving got but wasn't laughing very much onstage she's racist crude insensitive hugely self centered didn't took all face value got jesus magic think served as sarah silverman primer explaining just 'language' she's speaking she's like marilyn manson working hard faceful horrible ideas images but eventually realise isn't assault it's statement understand you're glad someone's finally giving straight don't mean suggest smart people understand hate prove idiocy while like lot 'smart' shows still day not humor curb enthusiasm impression it's good but just don't many people never sarah silverman program but i'm glad eventually came creators work hard episode loaded not just dialogue plot but songs dream sequences production numbers people aren't putting time slot advertisers appear mission make best predict future i'd say way arrested development freaks geeks canceled it's time live fans' hearts dvd but heart ssp creators audience we'll watching as long as let make 
big s isn't playing taboos forcing agenda like say mencia chapelle though like states obvious subtle near subliminal remarks won't change world nor meant but hilarious brian posehn paget brewster's ex boyfriend jay johnston "mr show" fame mean appetite destruction side's thoroughly wrecked episode look love woman like famed boyfriend jimmy kimmel just delivers lines lets viewer run best kind comedy spoofing like "mary poppins" second episode sings fake birds quick hitting commentary society college aged existential nonsense highly recommended but still funny bone didn't lose most recent lippo suction treatment boob job 
sarah silverman dangerous bitch she's beautiful sexy funny talent dark demonic read 'comment' as well as message board stuff people just don't nothing appears t v accident too much money time work production t v mistakes stupid sarah wanted stupid juvenile sarah wanted juvenile thought jokes great theme as well as musical numbers wonderfully bizarre it's lot like pee wee's playhouse maladjusted slacker glue sniffing future pornstars america valley cast awesome scenarios action well paced hope succeeds comedy central didn't let david spade plays sarah's sister not cast listing show's home page love stand up does know up coming dates dvds floating 
i think screamingly funny it's not taste i'm not going elevate denigrate folks don't i'm sure they're wonderful bright people operate different wavelength but like really like sarah plays self infatuated loser named "sarah silverman" often finds self homerian predicaments that's "homerian" as "homerian simpsonian" remember sarah silverman brief gig saturday night live early 90's liked immediately way check she's choke food wet pants funny therefore always fast watching wear adult diapers check 
sarah silverman like totally manic zooey deschanel think i'm love yeah loved jesus magic you'll love didn't heck wrong kudos comedy channel shoving face life finally meaning "your car smells like farts" kind humor i'm happy guy episode laughing hysterically i'm hungrily looking forward week like grease meets south park completely outrageous sarah silverman watch reading phone book delivery precise oh funny never skips beat come think it's not much choice material really good stuff way as way chooses deliver thank sarah silverman thank comedy channel 
for think strictly potty humor immaturity fact mindless while does contain share potty jokes contains lot satirical material pokes fun social problems racial barriers clich's stereotypes just need read material bit more love not punchline expecting formulated joke like friends love friends fyi won't instead sarah uses situations ways achieve humour more realistic don't walk world witty punchlines said most comedies instead sarah silverman program makes more realistic sense don't as mindless humor much more than 
this probably won't appeal sarah does wants doesn't ask permission doesn't apologize sitcom zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars team wallet stealing male cheerleaders star not hero spoiled bigoted pervert can't appreciate offbeat humor offers probably isn't least chance brings comedic styling sarah silverman brian posehn comedians comedy jay johnston mr steve agee bobcat goldthwait's 'stay' creative energies rob schrab dan harmon heat vision jack monster house showcases best talents burgeoning online community channel101 com you're eye "the department acceptable media" vh1 march it'll drawing talent pool watch sarah silverman's kind stuff future entertainment 
this incredibly hilarious couldn't stop watching marathon comedy central tonight despite fact i've seen all episodes previously i've always regarded silverman as huge talent finally vehicle talent enjoyed wide audience watch laugh very large percentage time can't say many tv shows finally new interesting most importantly funny never miss buy dvd as soon as comes owe watch predict long run series just clear people offended just don't lack intelligence comprehend stop making fools attacking don't understand uses word "bigot" reference silverman claims aims "shock" way mark she's exactly opposite just google you'll quickly she's huge proponent civil rights don't know she's ironically embracing all outrageous viewpoints don't don't rest favor quiet all enjoy hilarity

"cypher" cleverly conceived story industrial espionage set america not too distant future while thematically not complex film does offer many different perspectives personal loyalty ruthlessness corporate conspiracy certain extent film attempts represent modern corporate groups companies as indifferent risks contract employees behalf film starts somewhat mediocre salary man morgan sullivan jeremy northam applies digicorp group work as undercover operative initial briefing digicorp's security chief sullivan given new identity jack thursby sent business conference task recording speeches given various spokesmen concerning marketing strategies of respective companies successfully completing assignment sullivan thursby sent further missions obtain type information previously gathered however "business trips" inadvertently runs woman named rita foster liu met previous assignment things extremely topsy turvy implications diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp's espionage program begin emerge sullivan forced deep cover digicorp's main competitors thus double agent involved intense rivalry companies spoilers end liked most film efficient use lighting shadows lot scenes vivid lighting used mainly domestic household settings while lot shadows dark coloring used settings involving deception cover up very impressed jeremy northam not too often seen lead role fact plays disenchanted married man straight wisconsin brilliant personally think he's many under used actors industry hasn't given more challenging roles lucy liu incredible gave real cloak dagger tone additionally rest supporting cast did superb job however complaint characters explored more make plot closure little more complicated example loved happened jack thursby developed more intimate relationship second "wife " overall cleverly developed cloak dagger story keeps guessing very end personal professional loyalties entire film trusted smart stylish soundtrack great camera work film provides scary look corporations operate near future i'm surprised never watched "hidden gem" brilliant not too overly complicated spy thriller therefore i'm giving 9 10 
modern viewers know little film primarily as model remake "the money pit " older viewers today watch wisps nostalgia cary grant myrna loy melvyn douglas all "superstars" easier less complicated era time course way modifying perspectives many films today verily ulcerating social political commentary natural curiosity wonder controversy older seemingly less provocative films "mr blandings builds dream house " therefore more than audiences looking 1948 political commentary however subtle finding house late 40s truly exasperating experience lightly softened coming levittowns like politics the blandings children always talking progressive ideas taught school real life teachers accused communism real life too myrna loy housing activist democrat feminist melvyn douglas no less democratic firebrand married congresswoman helen gahagan douglas young richard nixon accused soft communism ruined jason robards sr small role film but political activism no less noticeable more importantly son jason robards jr many years very active liberal democrat almost odd fellow cary grant strident conservatism reflected majority political sentiment hollywood slipping but 1948 communism real perceived threat blacklist just corner decade political activism reappear mainstream films not subtly 
cypher well worth seeing it's not run sci fi flick artistic approach painted dark scenes kind macro view what's going close up camera view director keeps plot illusive sci fi aspect secondary plot the technology used isn't overly impressive however director makes good use props character development intentionally shallow main character jeremy northam decides immerse himself world espionage it's up audience figure enigmatic character it's enigma keeps audience interested right very end 
damn i've seen least 4 times still don't bored watching visuals good music totally awesome perfect fitting mind blowing cgis quite bad imho but whole visuals black white feeling totally sterile interiors just just genius perfect combination whole feeling feeling indescribable plot good however although little flaws like e g thought bit too "slow" but don't mean scenic parts totally loved got distracted very often totally complex story like underground bunker like thing digicorps all data saved conversation guy but just cheerful end displayed more emphasized getting true memory bit longer "louder" but again all flaws good never stopped watching again again 
this gem moves soft but firm resolution caution viewers although billed as corporate spy thriller ms liu moves deftly purposeful yet sedate pace it's not explosions car chases flying bullets patient instead note details it's sedate that's main character viewer watch think as story unfolds not spoilers destroys point watching plot you've read postings average white collar guy seeking change adventure signs corporate spy job just secretly record transmit inside data starts surreal walk background tang corporate disillusionment entwines itself quintessential underlying suburban paranoia begins accelerate acting all parts superb yes acts caricature characters but all fit entertain light piano rhyme background just perfect as soft soft key sinister theme all not right beginning end all not comfortable turn lights watch turn up sound wants listen

having read reviews film understandably started watching great deal doubt mind actually any good however best films seen long time majority reviews read said complicated plot too hard follow whilst parts leave confused ending ties up many loose ends feel like kicking you've missed much it's not like "lock stock " "snatch" sense isn't funny fact it's pretty dark lot more intelligent way parts scenes different viewpoints best scenes film jason statham spends minutes lift having argument himself way similar films just mentioned full memorable characters specifically statham gives fantastic performance as lead ray liotta spends most film speedos but gives great performance none less you've got time time think film watch again really start all symbolism hints laid film think it's fantastic guy ritchie director top game 
i start saying undeservedly panned just fact wasn't expecting especially guy ritchie expecting cockney geezers good liners "do ya like dags " but far more mature than previous works agree confusing but all facts just listen harder film demands all attention look past cool dazzling look film try listen dialogue than admire performances think all more thorough understanding whole film yes influences modern classics fight club pulp fiction but whole original direction pacing music score second none feel watched film over understand lot more maybe appreciate fine piece modern cinema hope ritchie continues vain as far prefer mockney "masterpieces" 
first all don't revolver expecting snatch lock stock different sort gangster film saw gala night definitely split audience it's kind half audience leave thinking that awful half leave thinking that cool personally like films don't understand e mullholland drive usual suspects enjoyed revolver definitely wasn't perfect though saw big twist coming mile away least though loose ends left unexplained good revolver leaves lot questions unexplained no reason scenes like animation scene sorter goes killing spree actually favourites although awesome scenes watch just awesome watch not fit however many good things too thought acting superb all main actors jason stratham ray liotta vincent pastore andre benjamin pleasant surprise definitely kept interest great suspenseful action packed scene ray liotta held under table wow well script extremely well soundtrack as most guy ritchie films great though step as fight club mullholland drive usual suspects still awesome fast paced psychological action many twists turns tons scenes remember long 
i watched today just blew mind away real masterpiece art don't understand most people think it's garbage main idea ego away true power main battle end guy ritchie shown magnificent way "the greatest enemy hide place look" remember true enemy ego voice always tells important gives pride tells not but creates aggression wants control creates all negative feelings thoughts gr expressed idea astonishing way shown way gain true control loose control just let personal importance superb 
i always enjoy seeing make think don't just drip feed answers audience "revolver" films although many reviewers stated difficult follow bit concentration open mind got time true doesn't compare mind mucks like "the usual suspects" "memento" but right intelligent thought provoking film thing really liked film damn beautiful scene camera angle thought ages you'll know mean conclude watch open mind enjoy not well no said "revolver" that's 2 cents 
in classic sense humors not specific concept funny entertainment altman's "h e l t h " treats all humors actually very funny entertaining ways there's phlegm as personified lauren bacall's very slow guarded protective character esther brill who's mission life appears all appearance protecting secrets age beauty more than well there's paul dooley's choleric dr gil gainey like fish water more like seal flops frenetically barking exhorting crowds subscribe aquatic madness melancholy glenda jackson's isabella garnell smacks shakespeare's troubled self righteous hamlet proffering soliloquy let's not forget henry gibson's bile character bobby hammer "the breast feeds baby rules world" there's characters harry wolff gloria burbank james garner carol burnett respectively relatively sane characters striving kind balance all companion extreme humors convened h e l t h kind world trade organization specializing h e l t h say but health altman classic best 
first all people hear 'guy ritchie' immediately think snatch yes snatch good but problem associates guy ritchie snatch don't expect explore new frontiers revolver different than snatch it's much darker very complex reason gave rating 10 i've watch revolver 3 times understand toys head it's very cleverly written different than snatch wonderfully cinematography beautiful recognize guy ritchie's personal touch style directing won complexity protagonist left more questions than answers 
ok far slated critics board posters alike although playing devil's advocate suggest critics often people didn't make as film makers board posters often people didn't make as critics wanted sit guy's corner magic sponge reach maybe couple people who've decided not film based everybody looking collective nose approval film's biggest flaw earning wide support unexpectedly complex described many times as as making film "inaccessible" viewer film's chronology relatively non linear characters used as not means storytelling but as device showing subtle not subtle hints bias things as commit memory ray liotta's character brandishing gun saying words "fear me" portrayed as tragically pathetic statham's pov interrogating bold liotta's pov but example ritchie's far more mature approach taken film making revolver storyline pretty archetypal strong but silent gritty anti hero gets released jail score settle but gets drawn inadvertently world corruption mean it's paint numbers film noir guys all way vague poetic choice diction gritty voice overs but guy taken framework make number extremely philosophical complex points scene jason statham's character runs afoul car throwaway sequence emitted film no difference story whatsoever but ritchie making point little chance happenings as receiving phone make difference life death final act pretty mind boggling i'd taking p ss said didn't spend 20 minutes film turning date going "uh wtf " but shoddiest reason disregard piece art far too easy dislike hard understand easier say "well nobody understand real turd film " humble opinion revolver stylish complex mature piece modern art greeted manner work saatchi brothers choose opportunity collectively say "ah sh t wanted film load bleeding' cockney gangsters nit loll guy ritchie tit " day come film makers allowed make expected shallow crappy people just guy himself funny cheeky cockney romps doesn't mean can't deep "pretentious" funny people thoughtful too

the sopranos stands as airtight dynamic exploration american life american experience shaped defined money setting story milieu underworld david chase eliminates all barriers grunt low ground outright mean deconstruction post modern era character represents facet american industry tony soprano exemplifies beleaguered working stiff torn familial duty need "business" keel convergence things imperative keeps story moving forward characters christopher paulie bobby reflect loyal but self serving underlings present enterprise trusted necessity than merit character ralph joe pantoliano essays brilliant interpretation charismatic psychopath twisted businessman who's flourishes violence tragically outweighed stunning earning power dominic chianese ultimate symbol antiquated old guard maintains power established relationships need up comers deflect blame though abrasive occasionally disturbing sopranos earned place as ultimate tv drama ps good companion piece chase's series shield violent drama manages make ugliest characters interesting

the sopranos most mind opening series possibly want watch it's smart it's quirky it's funny carries mafia genre well most people can't resist watching best aspect overwhelming realism characters set subterranean world new york crime families most time really don't know wise guys stab buy lunch further adding realistic approach characters depth personalities dangerous men most murderers but god don't love too i've laughed wisecracks torn they've err judgement felt scared sheer ruthlessness serious criminal suburban setting new jersey absolutely perfect show's subtext people aren't always as stark contrast humdrum actions taken seemingly petty criminals weigh up odds haven't most definitely 
i've watched series dvd but summarise sopranos as shakespearean plot tarantino like script series as good as goodfellas casino almost as good as godfather not "10" far better than any guy ritchie's efforts although there's plenty action pretty bloody story character driven minor characters contribute great story lines e g priest's relationship lack carmilla restaurateur's wife christopher dimwit friend didn't very long darwin award nominee apart plot script acting reasons liked 1 want visit new jersey eat pasta tomatoey sauce 2 music 3 shows literally suffer mental health problems 
it probably isn't fair got majority all interesting reviews sopranos add people forgotten but oh well standpoint acting any actor fail characters mesmerizing intense pursuits life tony soprano while mob "capo" suffering mental illness still sees life knows to survive men lives virtually inside like truest form voyerism definitely brings sort "nosey" viewer include myself while don't care bracco say freshest role years good fellas tony makes listen reason makes decent offers respite dealing human emotions failed feel long simply savior not speaking religious tones but knockout performance doubt edie falco prison guard role acclaimed hbo series "oz" as livia ultimate compliment any actor actress transcended boundries recognizable actress actresses like merle streep away sort chameleon quality transcend roles but as mentioned characters strong as any actor fail livia's strength daily affirmation faith herself survivor as hopes husband family survivors prepared worst knows hazards husband's business yet knows lifestyle more most women jersey wise not wiser more street savvy tony himself all all biggest crime soprano family viewer wait january 2000 season opinion worst thing hbo series brought larry sanders sex city dream earth popularity eventually killed too much space seasons very sporadic watch reruns hope gap programming filled
