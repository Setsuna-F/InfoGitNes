"sorry everyone I know this be suppose to be an art film but wow they should have hand out gun at the screening so people could blow their brain out and not watch although the scene design and photographic direction be excellent this story be too painful to watch the absence of a sound track be brutal the shot be too long How long can you watch two people just sit there and talk especially when the dialogue be two people complain I really have a hard time just get through this film the performance be excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take the only thing i like be Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this be a ripoff of Bergman and i be no fan f his either I think anyone who say they enjoy 1 1 2 hour of this be well lie",-1
"when I be little my parent take me along to the theater to see it be one of many movie I watch with my parent but this be the only one we walk out of since then I have never see until just recently and I could have live out the rest of my life without it What a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 's wine and cheese tripe Woody Allen be one of my favorite director but be by far the bad piece of crap of his career in the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman Allen give us a dark angular muted insight in to the life of a family wrought by the psychological damage cause by divorce estrangement career love non love halitosis whatever the film intentionally have no comic relief no music and be drench in shadowy pathos this film style can be well define as expressionist in nature use an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth but Woody Allen be no Ingmar Bergman the film be painfully slow and dull but beyond that I simply have no connection with or sympathy for any of the character instead I feel only contempt for this parade of shuffle whine nicotine stain martyr in a perpetual quest for identity amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and bake intelligentsia the story loom like a fart in the room Everyone speak in affected platitude and elevated language between cigarette Everyone be lose and struggle desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just go on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them it be never about resolution it be only about interminable introspective babble it be nothing more than a psychological drama take to an extreme beyond the audience 's ability to connect Woody Allen choose to make character so immerse in themselves we feel leave out and for that reason I find this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually drain I see what he be go for but his insistence on promote his message through Prozac prose and distorted film technique jettison it past the point of relevance I highly recommend this one if you be feel a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise let be just pretend this film never happen",-1

"a wear out plot of a man who take the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally wear out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually be shut out with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origin but scene after scene drone by with no change in intensity no character arc and inexplicable behavior the homosexuality theme be completely unnecessary or on the other hand completely unexplore it seem to be include only to titillate the viewer when will Hollywood learn that have gay character do not automatically make a more compelling picture a regrettably dreadful movie when will Lauren Bacall pick a good one I expect good of her and Kristin Scott Thomas this one be definitely one to miss",-1

"I be not alone in admire the first movie a film that Richard Donner execute masterfully I be also not alone in scorn Richard Lester 's 2 which bring us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie sadly it be still an absolute abomination 's world be one where suspension of disbelief be require in strong dose but 2 stretch thing too far it do n't matter who direct 2 because the script insult the intelligence of a first grader in a sense there be no plot because the character have zero motivation to act the way they do unlike the original superman with or without his power 's strength or lack thereof be handle in the least believable manner there be too much to criticize so I will not bother I condemn this movie perhaps the slapstick in the Lester version be more appropriate to the moronic script this movie be base on Super bad",-1

"superman II The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan 's dream come true at long last footage only see in photo and scene that only exist on the printed page would finally come to life a director that be unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restore it seem like a winning situation and then you start watch this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream be a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it be entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us have imagine over the year it really should have be a thrill to finally see this project and it be only a very few time you know thing be shaky when the very first bit of text on screen look like home brew computer graphics but then we start see new footage alternate from the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fade away Hey this be pretty neat thing be alright for these few fleeting moment until we see footage from intermix with new effect for this project and it do n't convince at all and from this point on it never ever let up it be probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effect but when this be supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line be you will believe a Man Can Fly it be difficult to believe anything show on screen here the good effect in this be from the original production another issue with this re cut a lot of it just do n't make sense the only reason any of it really work be because we have all see the theatrical version of II a movie that do make sense Lester 's II fill in the hole of this assembly part of this could be because Donner do n't get to complete shoot the other part could be because the maker of this project be intent on use as little Lester material as possible What we end up with be an assembly of footage that make IV look airtight and coherent after view this one get the sense that while Lester be faithful and comfortable use Donner material Michael Thau and his team be extremely disrespectful towards anything film by Lester the good scene in the Donner Cut be the one lift relatively intact from the release version of II that include the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both be film by Donner but anything else from that movie film by Lester be re edit in such a hasty fashion that it now make Lester seem like a ham fist know nothing while Lester honor the Donner material Lester here be throw under the bus so be there anything good in this release Well Marlon Brando be in it and that be neat to see in fact watch any of the material shot by Donner be neat since it be all film at the same time as The Movie but that only highlight the problem of this release any of the major scene really just Lois jump and scene with Marlon Brando would have be well serve as complete scene in a delete scene section instead they be shoe horn into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performance many alternate take from familiar scene be use sloppy edit and bad decision watch the opening scene at the daily planet why be we look at Jackie Cooper be back as he call for Lois and Clark at the end why do we have Lois walk into her dark apartment only to have that follow by Jackie Cooper walk into a dark bathroom turn the light on I be initially confuse by this because I expect to see Lois the entire assembly be fill with questionable choice like this Battle scene be a mess too with no geography between cut it be just random action of course the major action scene be shoot by Lester and his material be only use as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtake or alternate they should have use more of Lester 's footage but probably have too much pride to admit that the sloppiness extend to the military missile as well as note elsewhere the missile show in the Donner Cut bear the designation while we all know it be the a blind man in know that the producer of this assembly who try so hard to honor the original film drop the ball less than five minute in and that mistake be indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that be put into this the final product have an air of shoddiness to it that be inescapable the entire affair would probably be easy to digest if Warner 's do n't make this a separate release here in the state as it be we be expect to pay for what be essentially a bonus disc of delete scene with a Play all option it be really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scene but after that initial viewing I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else I know after my experience of watch this I have new respect for Lester 's version it be by no mean perfect but Lester realize the deficiency that be in the script that stand out here in bold relief he manage to make a movie that have entertain for many year and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remember as a footnote in that film history",-1

"we all know that some of the great movie of all time be base on book while not particularly accurate adaptation these movie be nonetheless excellent film some great example be the Harry Potter series the Lord of the Rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every Disney film ever make however I must regretfully announce that a Wrinkle in Time be not one of those movie not only do it fail to meet some of the most basic expectation of Madeleine 's fan base it manage to defy the standard of scriptwriting act special effect and ultimately respect for the audience you I be not try to be mean on the contrary I go into this affair with an open mind I figure that a make for T V movie would make up for its lack of razzle dazzle in its script after all the Star Wars spin off be decent if a little silly come to think of it the original Star war be make on a lunch money budget and look where it take George Lucas however from the first scene onward disappointment start envelop me as if I have get too close to the Black Thing while the same way shooting first become the symbol of the Star Wars special edition of a disaster of monumental proportion involve a disgruntled director make several hideous change to a beloved classic Mrs have officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that be a Wrinkle in Time the reason for this be the fact that she have be mutate beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of cast Alfre Woodard Star Trek First Contact and Radio as our favorite star turn mentor the filmmaker decide it appropriate to introduce her as a crow that be right a crow moreover the heavenly form of this greatly beloved character have be hack at by what look to be a demented eight year old the majestic half man half horse with wing have become a huge human head with a creepy smile mount awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happen to be sport a pair of wing in the middle have I be five this would have psychologically traumatize me for life the bad part be the fact that when it speak it be show from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync result in a scene that be spend look at the back of its head and see a single unmove cheek thus render the piece of special effect less believable than E T have get the most painful part out of the way I must go on to the tear induce one the character the acting and the story I personally have always imagine Meg to look somewhat similar to Myrtle from the Harry Potter film plain hair glass and a figure most would find laughable she be always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have care less about the import and export of Nicaragua in the film she be an unpleasant know it all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she make me feel sorry for poor Mr Jenkins her school principal who continuously have to deal with her Calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone think be a jock have jock the irony be horrible as for the memorable happy medium they take the pleasant old woman who like to look at happy thing and replace her with a being who be above gender and like to look at funny thing such as girl fall off of swing the only three people I can think of who do a decent job be Charles Wallace Mrs and the man with Red eye nickname the Dude with Red eye due to his complete as a character the story be a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie be Harry Potter and the of which do n't do a good job of retell the story find in the book yet keep the sole of the original work here the sole of the book be have a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body be be destroy as the Dark Lord complement the sole on how well it show that truth have to be feel and not see the flat nose of who replace the wondrous being who hold among their rank tear the spine up as the God of the Dead note how subtle the terror of the earth like be the torn page be scatter in the sandstorm and lose in the darkness of the land of evil I be very sorry that this film exist I do not believe that the actor be genuinely bad it be the way the character be write that ruin it a Wrinkle in Time deserve to be adapt by Lawrence direct by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg enhance at Industrial Light and Magic score by John Williams give its sound at Skywalker Sound edit by and market by Century Fox in its current state the film be unworthy to be show to self respect people even Madeleine think it be bad the book be good the film be bad and Mrs whatsit be ugly Score 0 1 if I could they get the name right Cons it have horrible problem with the Cliff Notes level of adaptation script act and special effect not to mention lack of evidence of ever have read the book Oh and the main cover poster have a picture of the three main character ride a fly horse over a castle some might say that this symbolize high adventure I say it symbolize the irresponsibility of the cover artist who do n't even bother to Meg 's arm on properly",-1

"this be a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scene of boring dialogue and monologue that be no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involve with it I sincerely think Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why do Erwin Elvira suicide at the end but instead of this in every scene somebody be try to explain when he be young this happen and he just come back from Casablanca and order to cut everything down there etc soon in the movie Erwin Elvira be in a slaughter house talk with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house be the good place for a pleasant little chat and while tell her the story of Elvira 's life Fassbinder show the killing of one cow after the other it be difficult to choose between give attention to the disturbing image or what the transvestite be say of course we come to the very force and coarse symbolism of I have suffer much in my life and be about to die in one of the sparse moment where actually happen something Erwin Elvira encounter a former lover that only after perform a extremely gay choreography with two other guy as if go for the necessary level of homosexuality be that he recognize Elvira there be some interesting shot and idea I must admit such as when the nun tell the story of the young Erwin but everything on the movie be waste due to Fassbinder 's self indulgence",-1

"someone will have to explain to me why every film that feature poor people and adopt a pseudo gritty look be somehow see as realistic by some people I do n't see anything realistic about the character although the actor do their good with really bad part or the situation instead I see a force self conscious effort at be edgy gritty and down and dirty sadly it take a lot more than hand hold the camera without rhyme or reason and fail to light the film to achieve any of the above quality in any significant way it be a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only film that see the inside of a movie theater be nowadays all carbon copy with bad cinematography non existent camera direction and a lot of swear strive to pass themselves as Art it be little wonder that film like in the or about Schmidt get such rave I find them to be meander and very average but compare to the current slew of independent clone like raise victor Vargas they be outright brilliant and inspire a few year ago see an independent film mean that you would likely be treat to some originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe a few technical glitch cause by the low budget nowadays it mean that chance be you will get yet another by the number let be shake the camera around for two hour attempt at placate the lack of taste of independent distributor and of course all that to serve character and situation that be completely unreal and contrived be it any surprise that the independent marketplace have few and few survive company not at all when you see film like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the bad of the film that precede them",-1

"I notice that the previous reviewer who appear to be still at school give this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this be because the reviewer have n't see the far superior BBC adaptation of this classic novel the major problem I have with this version be the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long Anthony Way be a talented boy treble who shoot to fame after appear in the TV mini series the I can only assume that he be cast for the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent acting in the unfortunately the small boy who appear in the have grow into a tall and gangly youth by the time Tom 's Garden be film and as such Anthony fail to convince as schoolboy Tom it be too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Tom as play by Anthony would befriend the far young Hatty in the BBC version Tom and Hatty be much closer in age and the development of their friendship be so much more believable for a movie even the special effect fail to convince and be not any noticeable improvement on the TV effect the casting and act of this version be inferior to the early adaptation and all in all the movie be a lack lustre version of a true classic as a final observation I would point out that the VBS of the BBC version fetch well over second hand whereas a new of this version can be buy for under 5 need I say more",-1

"when I see that Mary Louise Parker be associate with this epic novel turn film I be intrigue be a fan of the book I assume she will be play Tony Roz or Charis but more so I be intrigue to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who have n't read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfy for those who have the book be a complex reflection of society woman and modern life and I be interested to see how they use the 3 different narrative that lead to the unfold of the story in a film What they actually do be a crime the big error and confusing issue be why would a network that advertise as be for woman take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible woman be and can be and change the protagonist from 3 woman to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involve in the story it seem like whoever adapt it take an easy way out by use this guy to straight up ask Roz Tony and Charis about how they know Zenia and in do that they rush through bulk of the book in do this though they muddy the story and cut everything that be great about the character in it aside from make it so the audience have no one credible to associate with in the film these woman be n't people they be character in the book Zenia do fake her death but the book mention it to get this point across while the film waste minute focus on this former cop run around and do nothing of use they try to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order or it turn out that Mary Louise Parker play Zenia which be so wrong Zenia be a Catherine Zeta Jones Angelina Jolie or maybe even a Scarlett type she be a woman man ca n't not adore and a woman that woman be intrigue and threaten by but in a keep your enemy closer kind of way and once she get closer she seem totally genuine and trust worthy despite your good judgment she be the kind of woman who even when she lose she win she be always still beautiful still rich and there be always still people out there who do n't know her game in the film Zenia do n't take Charis 's man the blonde American draft dodger who be use Charis in the first place but instead take August and try to become her legal guardian and apparently come back to be her Lesbian lover as a linger kiss at the coffee shop imply and Zenia do kill the chicken before leave with August but it make no sense since all of the build up to it be remove it be be as if whoever write the screenplay be grasp at straw to satisfy those of us who read the book but I think have I not read the book I would have spend the whole movie confuse if I have bother to stick with it at all and Roz 's husband be dead before Zenia come in to the picture which be weird since Zenia take Roz 's business and home life in the book which be why Roz hate her so much and she and Zenia have conspire to kill Roz 's husband year and year back and accord to the film Tony and West have be date forever even at the party where Zenia and West in the book have paint the whole place black and they make Tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who be always respect by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it Tony 's character be so wrong in this film she seem a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspire be go down as oppose to the kind of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she be in the book the film basically imply smart woman be evil beautiful woman be evil powerful woman be evil and woman who teach yoga be off their rocker they basically try to make it so Zenia be n't necessarily as awful as she be in the book and then in the end the three woman convince this former cop who of course in the process of research this meet Zenia and have an affair with her that be suppose to end with them move to Barbados or something ridiculous which of course Zenia bail on to hide Zenia 's body which they find splat at the hotel she be stay at but the film imply that one of the three woman push her over the balcony or they conspire together to do it and then Zenia also manage to take all of Roz 's money in the process by the end of the film I be only half pay attention between commercial b c it have spiral so far out in space from what it could and should have be if you be n't confuse by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because I have read the book and see the movie and from the movie alone I be ridiculously confuse it be terrible I get that make a film out of that book be quite a task but if you be go to take on the task you should start by determine what in the book be unnecessary instead of create some useless character to be our Alice in wonderland be there really no fluffy book that could be make at least half decent TV movie of",-1

"this be the beginning of it all grant this be not friend at its good but this be the show 's pilot let be not forget and not a bad one at that we be introduce to the gang and Central where our story begin even from this first episode we get a sign of the Ross Rachel relationship that will come over the next ten year when Ross say I just want to be marry again and Rachel storm in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writer be go for a Monica Joey relationship but fit nicely now when look back something else in this episode Rachel be introduce to Chandler as if the two have never meet before but in late episode the so call flashback this be contradict as the two have meet on three previous occasion nevertheless the point be this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friend as we be accustom to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episode we see why the show come to be what it be keep watch first season be a blast",1
"here it be the first episode of friend where we get introduce to Control freak Monica Courtney Cox newly divorce Ross David Lisa unknown actor and ladies man Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing Matthew Perry this be how the scene start off until we introduce to the 6th and final friend kid Rachel Green Jennifer the episode be good than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode be n't always fantastic the acting in this episode be n't great because the cast can identify and really believable in their new character apart from and Perry who shine Matt Le Blanc Man his acting be down right dreadful because until late he get more confident but i think he try to be funny but at most fail David why do he over pronounce word he can speak normally but he become one of the funny character in late season but he be n't confident and i can sympathise with him Jennifer hot and do a good job as Rachel Green but we only see the real Rachel late in the 1st season Courtney Cox quite anorexic in this episode its worry she look totally different now more healthily she act be a little sketchy but be in this minute pilot Lisa and Matthew Perry I be do these two together because their comic timing and act quality be superb and for Lisa this be one of her first role and she be so natural as and Matthew Perry be just Matthew Perry play himself basically the episode quality do improve later such as the set they look dark and creepy in this episode and make them seem unfriendly the acting be OK the character gain confidence with each new scene and i be proud this be the pilot I hope we see the Friends reunite cause they will always be there for us",1
" SG 1 be a spin off of sort from the movie I be so glad that they decide to expand on the subject the show get it roll from the very first episode a retire Jack O'Neill have to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion Dr Daniel Jackson through the first two episode we meet Samantha Carter a very intelligent individual who let no one walk over her and there be a quiet compassionate warrior who defy his false god and join the team the main bad guy be call the they be parasite who can get insert into one 's brain thus control them and do evil deed any who have a massive amount of power be often deem as a System Lord the warrior behind the be call Jaffa who house the parasitic in their body until the can get insert in a person 's brain through the episode we mostly get to see SG 1 the exploratory team comprise of Jack Daniel and Sam go through the wormhole that instantly transport them to other planet this device be call the and they encounter new culture or bad guy some episode be on world mean that they do not go through the once in the episode and rather deal with press issue on earth through the year you start to see a decline in the SG 1 team as close knit and more character build story line this in turn mean even more on world episode which be perfectly understandable my rating 8 while most of this show be good there be some instance of story line not always get wrap up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few year but still top notch science fiction",1
"the pilot be extremely well do it lay out how the character bond in future episode I do n't think anyone could have create a good pilot for this show it display remarkable creativity on the writer part although not everything be straighten out because it be the very first episode a lot of event that happen in future season be demonstrate in the pilot an example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appear it be overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice Bravo a great start to an unbeatable comedy",1

"well its about time I have really give up any and all hope that there be go to be a standout episode among this season 's entry while there have still be far too many drab to entry at least this episode turn out well its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only have the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only script chore to date have include Tale of the and should be the one to give us the well written and most think provoke episode of the season in right To die we be treat to the story of Cliff and Abbey at the start of the episode the couple be have a conversation Abbey have catch Cliff cheating and he be desperately try to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff be leave with only scratch and bruise but Abbey be throw from the car and catch on fire when a spark ignite and gasoline that have drip onto her catch her on fire and this be just the setup people once in the hospital Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflex there be also a side effect too every time she Abbey go a walking as a ghost and cause trouble for all sort of people Hands down this be the good episode of the season and certainly rank as one of the top episode ever from the gruesome effect to the taut script which throw in a few twist I never see come and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right To die should have the right to go on live forever",1
"a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife be leave in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pull the plug and let her live the decision be make even hard when he realize her ghost want to extract revenge on him and those around him this come to us from director Rob Schmidt who make wrong turn a film I have not see with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that I be a bit reluctant to watch this episode expect Schmidt to be a Master of in only the most liberal sense my apology to him for my underestimation as of episode in a episode season this be actually the good one yet the issue of the right to die be deal with and cover in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this be only the foundation on which the story revolve once the horror element show up the film go from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense I be a little out at time which be good and most of all the gore be in extreme abundance I read a review of this episode prior to watch it where the reviewer say there be a strong hint of in this through the first part of the show I have no idea what they be talk about then there be a bit later where some image do remind me of 2 however I in no way wish to say that this take away from the film I can see no other way to create the effect that be create and in my opinion this look remarkably well than 2 some plot twist show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look I do n't watch it a second time but I think the beginning would make more sense if I have not that it be confuse the subplot with the dental hygienist be also nice and I find myself go back and forth about whether I dislike the main character for his relationship with her or if I feel bad for him he be somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story if you will I feel incline to cheer for him as the protagonist but he be completely unlovable while the Stuart Gordon episode may be well and I be excite about the Washingtonians episode I think I could safely bet that this be the key episode of the season and by far the save grace of what be otherwise lackluster and routine when legend like John Carpenter let me down again I get a bit worry about the genre 's future but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt come along and give me hope this one be a keeper and please bring Schmidt back for season 3",1

"all i hear about be how poorly the animation be do it may not be up to par with what everyone expect but look at it this way Would you expect perfection in hell it be my belief that the animation be make dry and gritty on purpose it be great to see her character transformation in this movie consider it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get I hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be good off with Chastity or I do n't think Lady Death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it be my own personal belief that all the naysayer about this movie be dead wrong no pun intend",1

" SG 1 follow the intergalactic exploration of a team name SG 1 through a device call the and all the surprise await on the other side of the wormhole have see this series sporadically for it be first few season when it first come out I do n't know how good this series would really be year after I have last see an episode my old impression be that the series be great but my impression be far from the truth SG 1 be more than just a simple series it be one of the most well make interesting long run exciting ever produce and why because it run on an amazing premise this series value far surpass that of the movie it be base on and I think it be a very good example that television as a medium with a suitable premise be able to provide something that do n't work on the time restriction of film the sense of familiarity create by a long run series watch the character and their circumstance progress with time be stunning and just add to the ability to suspend disbelief and it be all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show SG 1 keep offer great adventure throughout the year but be never afraid of the challenge of move the plot and it give way for some very different time period of the show the first few season perhaps up to the 4th 5th focus a lot more on the exploration of planet and different situation keep the episode fairly unrelated to each other if it be not for the always impending will threat from the 5th to the 7th there be increasingly more episode focus on fight the will and prevent attack on earth after this season exploration of the planet be almost only an excuse for put 1 in a place of have conflict the 8th season be probably the most mixed one it have a stream of episode that include minor earth matter in which the be hardly even mention but the last episode feature some great moment the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O'Neil they be both good continuation although the first few episode of the 10th season be a little weak because they seem to be about little more than SG 1 and human Jaffa lose battle after battle to the Ori basically after season 7 exploration be push to the background which in many way be a shame because of the potential and mystery each planet episode present on the other hand it make for so many great episode of the ongoing conflict that the change of nature of the show still work and show how great and bold the writer be even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely put it to rest the feeling I have be that it could go on the people involve be all great professional and the series narrative have plenty to offer a last season return to the begin nature of the series be very doable and would have be most welcome but ultimately thing be as they be in the end because of the fact that I enjoy everything it be a little hard to find that it end the big picture however the one draw by the work of hundred of people over the course of year be a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew those outstanding actor and the character the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG 1",1

"I do try not to take rating to heart but I be flabbergast when I see the 5 4 rating to one of my childhood favourite it do n't wow me as much at but as a family film this be a sweet and well mean movie kid will definitely love it and wo n't mind the flaw and the adult can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal message of the film none of the film be preachy in any way in fact it have a great message that add to its sweetness I will admit though that the story be on the thin side and some scene like 's death which still freak me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation be well above average with nice colour and good character animation the music by James Horner be very beautiful and the song feature be memorable catchy and amuse I really like the character Louie be probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaur be at least engage Martin Short 's clown be both hilarious and emphatic the part when he tell I quit have me in stitch my favourite be though an effective villain who be crafty and I suppose intelligent if anything though I wish the film keep in the part when he explain how he lose his eye and why he be scare of crow because that way he could have be more develop in term of depth the script while not Oscar worthy have its funny and heart warming part and should keep kid and adult entertain the voice act for me be what make the movie John Goodman Martin Short Rhea Perlman Felicity Kendall and Smith all give solid performance but special mention have to go to Kenneth Mars for he be absolutely superb as and almost All in all this be a good movie I do n't get the rating honestly I do n't sure this film be n't perfect and it be not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land before Time but it be good fun 7 5 Bethany Cox",1
"I see this when it first come to video my little sister get it as a gift and I be probably at the time What stand out for me be the lack of mid movie conflict that so many movie have where the main character get mad at each other because when it come time to explain themselves they just do n't say the one thing that you be shout at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this be what I like the most about the movie I guess that the main character do n't do mean thing to each other halfway through they do n't break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie go on these two kid team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite side of the track they be not that different be actually just some middle class kid that need to realize how lucky he be to have a loving family and Cecelia be an upper class kid that just need to prove to her family that she exist and they would miss her if she be go anyway I see this movie post on and have to watch it again sure there be plot hole if you analyze the script and no and should n't be eat hot dog since they would have be herbivore in reality now what detract from the film be it be unexpected little kid under the age of 5 would probably be frighten by the scene with Dr and the addition of him halfway through the movie though it be blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance be too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him do his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that it be not that scary without the the dinosaur I guess it just lack any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lack a little continuity when he appear for the second half consider the target audience who I be sure can overlook the not so mind blow animation and dialog issue I think I will give it a pass on those factor too and just enjoy the story it be a great flick for kid and it do stick in your mind make you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisit every year I think",1
"its great i love it ha cause i love dinosaur they r the great animal but i love the show cause it be n't copy from another show and it be a original ha it have a good storyline and great for little kid if they like dinosaur that be i have a few down too its not all that great cause of the dinosaur look a little mutate so i should have have but a 7 but right now be a little late for that 4 more line to go it be great for a fantasy show though warn this might spoil a part for u so if u do n't want it to be spoil do n't read on near the end be kinda weird cause all they need to do be get dang i forget what it be so guess its not a spoiler so never mind i love it and its my opinion and sorry for any miss spell word if any",1

"my rating refer to the first 4 Seasons of SG 1 which be wonderfully fresh creative and addict when the cast step through the gate you never know what lie on the other side start around Season 5 the show take a different focus still good but different the series follow the adventure of a team of human and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device call the the of the series be base on the character and event of the movie in which the device be discover during an archaeological dig in Egypt the episode be light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive storey could easily have be make into great movie of their own What happen next be always unpredictable the character on which the show rest be also well define and brilliantly perform their tone be serious but the dialog be flower with incredible wit and humor they be simply fun to watch start somewhere around Season 5 the series start to evolve into a continuing storyline base on fight a single foe the then the Ori the plot become more complex a lot more political strategic oriented and interdependent the character be still as great as ever but the show be different in nature One thing that must be mention be to watch the episode that commemorate the 100th and episode they be simply ca n't miss show they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carry the series through season if you be a fan watch a few episode of the first 4 Seasons and you will likely be hook if you like evolve story line between two oppose side you have season of show to look forward to",1

"first off this be not suppose to be a brilliant and think provoking film like so many other reviewer seem to compare it to the first review say something along the line of anyone who like this know nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around if one be to look back after the film it really be n't mean to be convince it be a low budget ipecac but really all it be aim for it be mean to blow viewer away with sheer shock value and all the flaw it its visual be much less noticeable back in the original VBS version I give this one a high score because it reach its goal and even though it be not downright horrific in non shock sense it do make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid pessimistic i do n't trust anyone for about a week because i do n't want to wake up string up and torture",1

" House of Games be a flawlessly construct film and one of the few film I have see that have me gape at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it end I first see it on video a few year back after read Roger Ebert 's review which proclaim it the good film of I have my doubt mainly because it be not quite as well know as other film from that year Boy be I in for a surprise this be one of the smart most well write movie I have ever see the screenplay be quite a piece of work not only in term of the plot which twist and turn and pull the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figure out but also in term of character development on my second viewing I begin to realize that Mamet 's screenplay succeed not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contribute to our understanding of the character and their motivation the climax of the movie be particularly effective because it be absolutely inevitable it stem naturally from what we know about the character and it be therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist end the performance by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film I can picture any other actor besides Mantegna play the role of Mike and Crouse play her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus Mamet 's extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the great film of the be it be truly a must see",1
"just watch the film for the 3rd time and enjoy Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before it just keep get well and well you simply have to marvel at the carefully measure way of speech the slow deliberate action everything be exactly in place Truly one of the great one and definitely my all time favourite",1
"unique movie about confused woman Lindsay Crouse who get involve with sharp con man Joe Mantegna give an Oscar caliber performance as the slick of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as Mantegna show Crouse the rope of his con game story line unravel a bit later on but still stand as a unique portrayal of an innocent catch up in a dark world worth a shot",1
"house of game have a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offer to help a patient with his gambling debt and get catch at the game have you ever feel fascination for something that be both dangerous and wrong watch what happen if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as trickster be be trick and victim turn into perpetrator you be never sure of who be exactly who in this movie this be both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie end you feel that the story lack a bit of consistency but all this be largely compensate by the excellent psychological development this be definitely one of the good movie about gamble",1
"plenty have be write about Mamet 's the House of Games most of it good I decide to revisit the flick to see how it hold up after year and be surprise at how much I enjoy view it again the film 's success and durability probably have much to do with two principal ingredient which be always fun on film a good story and a good scam Mamet manage to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while us the audience and the mark simultaneously then he explain the art of con only to do it again etc all the while build the story the House of Games now a freebie on cable be worth a look for first timer and an okay rerun for Mamet fan",1
"this typical Mamet film deliver a quiet evenly pace insight into what make a confidence man Joe Mantegna good as a psychological study by a noted psychologist Lindsay Crouse it slowly pull her into his world with the usual nasty consequence the cast include a number of the player find be several of Mamet 's film Steven Goldstein Jack Wallace Ricky Jay Andy Allen Soule William H Macy and they do their usual good job I love Lindsay Crouse in this film and have often wonder why she do n't become a more noted player than she have become perhaps I be not look in the right place the movie proceed at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintain a level of tension throughout which logically lead to the bang up end you will expect a real let down at the end but I find it uplift and satisfy I love this movie",1
"I enjoy this show for two reason 1 Richard Dean Anderson 2 Amanda these two performer carry the show with able support from the regular and recur actor the replacement of in season 9 be enough to take the heart out of the show the chemistry between all the main character be just tremendous you get the feeling that the actor like to pal around after the camera stop roll this relationship carry over into the program we get to see give his O'Neill character believable personality he never know when to give the in him a rest you watch the other roll their eye in dismay at some of his utterance still they know that he be the man to have around when the situation be perilous there be a lot go on between Carter and O'Neill under the surface they manage to keep the lid on but often just barely the episode solitude in season 1 have some of the good drama ever see on television the love between the two make the prospect of die bearable because they face it together Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence create by O'Neill yet O'Neill 's tactical instinct always seem sound he understand what to do without have to think about the matter the team have several time be place in jeopardy by the other not listen to his order the quality decline markedly in season 9 and the original story arc be mostly use up and the new villain never really catch my interest Ben Browder be far inferior to in carry the show he have his rare moment with Claudia Black but that be all Amanda be phone in her performance these two season you could see her greatly change appearance after have a baby she be probably think more about the child than the show the spin off Atlantis have a few moment but be mostly a weak effort the major character lack the chemistry of the cast of the original The villain wraith be so improbable as to be ludicrous maybe Amanda can breathe some life into the program or it wo n't last beyond the fourth season there have always be a problem for me in the special effect for the show To have spaceship shape as pyramid be a design monstrosity seldom equal in the use of torch for illumination in these ship be just as bad the campy use of decor from ancient Egypt conceal ultra modern technology be just as hard to accept I wonder about some of the continuity on the show too in the season 2 opener Daniel Jackson be shoot up and his uniform have a gape hole where he be wound he crawl into a sarcophagus and it heal his body and restore his uniform like it just come off the rack in the wardrobe closet the episode Hathor have a sarcophagus fall into the hand of the SGC yet it be never mention again this device could have be use in several late episode on Daniel O'Neill and Dr Frasier",1

"get ready for it this be one of my favourite film of all time I be relatively unaware of David Mamet 's writer and director other work but after have watch this film half a dozen time it be always a joy to watch I can say without hesitation that he be a genius this film be extremely well write and quickly draw you in to its milieu of deceit con artistry and back room hustle the feel of the film be very similar to the and it also pay homage to film noir it be quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you think about the various plot twist and motive of the shady character it be slightly predictable at time but the shocking climax be always exciting to watch generally the acting be superb especially Joe Mantegna but someone who I watch the film with remark to me that it be not a good idea to have a heroine Lindsay Crouse who be not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sport a bad 's hairdo I agree but I think she be nevertheless outstanding in the role the less you know about the plot of this film the well just like Mamet 's most recent film the Spanish prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive just sit back and be prepare to be take for a ride by a movie that come dangerously close to brilliance",1
"open the film with a Bach be an aural hint of what be to unfold in this intense drama All the compositional device bach perfect to keep his listener and the performer intrigue and entertain apply to this film there be n't a mutual tenderness between the two lead character and the lead female in the final scene I feel be justify in state she be rape even though her victimizer feel she be forewarn that he be a cad Mamet compellingly explore the emotional chasm and difference between the gender but I feel he be clueless about how they actually compliment one another give a healthy sense of humor if Mamet ever develop a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the gender I wonder how this work would have end as it exist it be very somber and mean spirited",1
"this be very nearly a perfect film the idea would be repeat by Mamet but never tell so succinctly this be really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weave the idea that we be all criminal no one be innocent be there anyone alive today who have n't see this play out in our own society every single day the film be very much structure like a Hitchcock thriller except there be no more innocent character the world be now completely polluted ruin and everyone be participate in the con Could anything be more true do n't miss the soundtrack it be wonderful",1

"I be not great at write review so I will just spout my opinion I love this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama I think it be all brilliant Anderson Shanks Judge Davis I love them all Davis it seem be the fifth most important person in the cast not a big deal but when his character General Hammond leave at the end of the seventh season and Anderson 's character Colonel O'Neill move from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fall off a cliff I do n't know whether it be because Hammond be more important that I realize or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turn to the first seven season though be awesome the movie seem mediocre the first time I see it but it turn out to be even if this be n't the original intention a brilliant setup to the series I recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the TV series then watch the movie again you will have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the TV series the last three season of the series be n't nearly as good as the first seven but that do n't mean they be n't good it just mean they be a letdown if you have get spoiled by the first seven season after you have finish this series be sure to watch the spin off series Atlantis it be a worthy successor to this brilliant series on 7 I just find out that Don S Davis die a few week ago it be a great loss",1

"I would have rate the series a perfect for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development have it not be for the last episode of Season the final episode of the 10th season where it would certainly appear that the have be kill off in a very rush unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion leave me in disbelief from the extremely rush end of the series it be obvious that many of the story arc be originally schedule to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerate these storey to position the SG 1 franchise for the two upcoming direct to move unless the return in a future SG 1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction I think that the fan have be cheat with a poor clean up of loose end poor end to an otherwise brilliant series",1
"I first hear about this film about year ago when I be a kid in grade school it just so happen that I be thumb through the encyclopedia in the classroom one day and under the entry for movie or cinema I do n't remember be several still for different movie from mainstream to experimental and one of them show on the page be a still for it really intrigue me since it stand out the most on the page it be a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other element superimpose over it about or so year later the public library here where I live have available for checkout the whole 4 set of of American Film Archives release by the National Film Foundation so when I be read the note on the case for the set I be quite pleasantly surprise to see that be on one of the disc after all these year I could finally see the film after view it it slightly be n't be I be expect it to be it tend to be a more organic look film not that that be a bad thing but I be expect it to have a more electronic aesthetic but it be still an impressive film consider the technique Scott Bartlett use to make the film include hand tint the film itself and use video equipment for some of the film 's scene film off of a video monitor give it a more distressed re look do n't get me wrong the technique use in this film be quite grind breaking for that be why it be still one of my favorite short experimental film and a creative inspiration for me as well",1
"a very funny movie it be good to see Jim Carrey back in top form it be definitely worth the price of admission Morgan Freeman and Jennifer both play outstanding support role in this film I think they may have play the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see",1
"Bruce one of Carrey 's good picture since well a long time it contain one of the funny scene I have see for a long time too Morgan Freeman play God well and even chip in a few joke that be surprisingly funny it contain one or two romantic moment that be a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scene the good scene in it be where Jim be mess up the anchor man 's voice My rating 8",1
"this film be the good film Jim Carrey have ever make Carrey do not have his usual face make stuff in this film he be both funny and sad Carrey play a reporter name Bruce Nolan Nolan blame God Morgan Freeman for everything that go wrong in his life then God come down from heaven and give Bruce his power as I say before Carrey do an excellent job I also think that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer be great as support actor actress the plot be good because it have many in the main point this movie can be funny Bruce 's dog as well as sad the break up the script work well too I be glad they make a sequel to this film I rate this film a 9",1
"if you want a serious laugh pain watch this movie and the thing Bruce inflict on his fellow newscaster the delete scene be priceless I do n't know why they do n't include them in the original movie it ca n't be because of time since the movie be only minute long Morgan Freeman be a brilliant actor who have be overlook for too long Jim Carrey need",1
"as someone who live near Buffalo New York this movie score point with me before I even see it since the story be base here there be even some bit part with real life news TV anchor people from Buffalo and for once it do n't knock the area wise God be still make to look and think like human and of course be a bit on the liberal side be the lightweight comedy it be it be nothing that should win any award but it still be entertaining and be a pleasant way to kill minute there be some laugh out loud slapstick comedy scene and hopefully audience from Christian to atheist get something out of this besides a few laugh such as what prayer should really be all about to the writer for at least get that theology correct and give a good message overall it be a good heart film that should offend very few",1
"I really do not know what people have against this film but it be definitely one of my favourite it be not preachy it be not anchor by it be moral it should n't be controversial it be just God any possible God no matter the religion and it be really funny Jim Carry play Bruce Nolan a TV reporter usually stick on the light side of the news desperate to prove himself more or less TO himself that he can be take seriously and do a good job in an anchor job this drive be what be slowly drive his beautiful girlfriend Grace Jennifer away when the final straw be execute he be quick to not laugh but yell in the face of God who in turn give Bruce his power Bruce then make his life well for himself until he be into help other where he then continue to miss the point of his power meanwhile his constant excitement about his own life make him more selfish leave his relationship on dangerous ground OK that be kinda long but as a plot it work well the step by step fashion in which we meet the challenge of be God be much well than cluster his problem together and be able to hide itself fairly well as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place Carrey 's pitch perfect act stays in character which luckily enough be him and control and give atmosphere to the movie scene by scene whether they would admit it or not the role be write or rewrite exclusively for Carrey without him the humour would turn flat as humour be half execution and the humour be very good in the first place but without Carrey it would kinda feel like a it be a Life Jennifer be great and no matter what some may say do not act like the only excuse for the third act at least you do n't think that when you see her she give a heartfelt performance and make you forget you be watch a movie she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple the movie feel see the movie to understand have a very nice feeling tackle the idea appropriately and good than expect and overall should never have be call slap together just to save Carrey 's career which be n't anywhere",1
"well be Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns this film sure be good than that bore oh God I be totally engross and all the way through Carrey be perfect as the out of sort anchorman and carry off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well play performance I for one do n't consider her to be either ugly or untalented I think my favorite scene be when Carrey open up the file cabinet think it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that hold the event of his bathroom humor I be roll over this one well write and even well play out this comedy will go down as one of this 's good",1
"I nominate this and Babylon 5 as the good television series make both stand out in my mind because unlike early Star Trek series there be a consistent evolution of plot and character if you look at the original Star Trek and Star Trek they be fine show but there be no overall theme or plot that connect all the episode in many way you could usually watch the show totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what be occur this be less the case with Deep Space 9 with its giant battle that take up all of the final season and the other Trek show as there be more of a large story that unify them this coherence seem to have develop as a concept with Babylon 5 and see this to an even great extent with SG 1 the bottom line be that in many way this series be like watch a family or a long novel slowly take form sure there be a few throwaway episode that be not connect to the rest but these be very few and far between and be also usually pretty funny and speak of funny I love that SG 1 keep the mood light from time to time and be n't so dreadfully serious in this way I actually enjoy it more than Babylon 5 Jack O'Neill be a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson it be really too bad he slowly fade from the series in late season To truly appreciate SG 1 you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plot work this coherence give the show exceptional stay power and if you do n't like SG 1 after give it a fair chance then be probably the genre for you",1
"Starring Jim Carrey Morgan Freeman Jennifer Anniston I be really quite skeptical the first time I watch this movie I mean what a conceptual Jim Carrey play God Nothing be sacred anymore well this movie be hardly sacred but it also be not sacrilegious at least not to any great extent Yes Jim Carrey have the power of God for a while but he be not God I will give you the low down Jim Carrey play Bruce Nolan a reporter who be down on his luck and feel very unsuccessful with his life he live with his beautiful girlfriend Grace Anniston and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship be on fairly shaky ground then Bruce get a shot at anchorman only to have it underhandedly steal by Evan Baxter obviously not please Bruce share his thought with the world through the television in a way which be comical and definitely worthy of get him fire much complain and gripe about God later Bruce get a page after a while he get tired of it call so he respond and go to the Omni building there he meet God Freeman who be the Boss and of the building I find this highly amusing God be the Boss the Holy Spirit be the and Jesus Christ be the janitor think about it Boss obvious the guy who keep everything run the guy who clean up the mess that the world have leave brilliant anyway Bruce be a little skeptical about have actually meet God but when God give Bruce his power and give him a shot at play God he start to believe a bit wonder why Enter the flagrant abuse of power for personal gain and to abuse the enemy since this be Hollywood Bruce obviously eventually smarten up learn his lesson and start use his power for the good of the world in the end he cry out for God to take it away and pray that his will be do not Bruce 's since it be Jim Carrey the movie be quite amusing and there be definitely some highly entertaining moment in it the movie be not perfect theology but for Hollywood it be definitely a good attempt many statement in the film can be quite think provoking and even challenging and I applaud Tom for his effort in this movie so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it Bottom Line 3 5 out of 4 worth a view or two",1
"Jim Carrey be back to much the same role that he play in the Mask a timid guy who be try to get ahead in the world but who seem to be plague with bad luck even when he try to help a homeless guy from be harass by a bunch of hoodlum and of course they have to be Mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfire in that case it be n't too hard to predict that he be about to have a handful of angry hoodlum but I like that the movie suggest that thing like that should n't be ignore I be remind of the episode of Michael Moore 's brilliant the awful when they have a man lie down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he be okay the result be not very promising so it be nice to see someone in the movie set a good example Jim Carrey play the part of Bruce Nolan the nice guy mention above whose entire life seem to be fall apart or even well it seem to be break up by the blow of bad luck like an asteroid enter the atmosphere a little metaphor that come up when Bruce miraculously find himself a gigantic news story later in the film Bruce be nearly year old and all he have to show for it be a position as a news reporter of the sort that report on such exciting news as the local bakery that be seek to bake the world 's big cookie he be desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station but he lose his cool on live TV when he hear that the job go to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him second before his first live report needless to say he lose his temper on live TV in one of the funny scene of the entire film Morgan Freeman deliver a fantastic performance as the man himself display a God whose infinite wisdom be somewhat reflect through Freeman 's massive talent as an actor he be the kind of God who take his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his follower as well as the viewer of this movie that there be time when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life I love his line that some of the happy people in the world come home smell to high heaven at the end of the day there be a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who be so absorb by their money and their possession and their job and everything that they completely lose touch with the natural side of themselves as human One of the big strength be that the movie be able to provide great advice to people in general about improve their life and this message be clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer 's religion I for example tend to reject organized religion in all form and I see God and Satan to be metaphor for different aspect of nature and human psychology rather than actual figure who ever live or continue to live but despite the fact that I do n't believe that God exist as an entity oversee the universe or as a janitor dress all in white who mop the floor of his downtown office in his spare time I be able to appreciate the message that be deliver in this movie Jim Carrey 's movie display this fantastic evolution that tie them all together and make the new one look even well just because you can see how far he be come if you compare Bruce with movie like Ace Ventura both of which I love by the way or a lot of what he do before he get into film it be amazing how far he have come he have move from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic film to comedy that be truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as other like the Truman Show Man on the Moon and the Majestic easily one of his great film ever Jim Carrey have unmistakably move from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actor work today Jennifer also once again provide an excellent addition to the movie as she do in the side splitting Office Space as Bruce 's girlfriend who become increasingly exasperate by Bruce 's grow stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there be definitely some low brow comedy in the film that do n't really fit with the importance of the film 's meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog read the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it be definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura 's friend Spike make a cameo appearance as Stephen King very well know it be always nice to see familiar character it be almost like see family again Bruce be endow with the power of God for a give period of time so that he can understand life a bit well and he say a lot about himself when he use the power only for his own purpose rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing I love about this be that like I say before religion be absent from my life but I be able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by think about what kind of thing I would have do have I be endow with such power the movie allow us to learn vicariously this way which empower the message even more the scene that involve the news station be easily the funny in the entire film such as the scene when Bruce lose his temper about the anchor position the Jimmy Hoffa scene who be conveniently bury with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental record the scene where Bruce 's rival colleague be make to go nut on camera and my favorite the one at the beginning and the end involve the local bakery be cook the movie have plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent joke such as when he say to God who reveal that he be the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his Christmas party must be real bash and to be careful about drink because on of him might need a ride home I also love the end when he say that behind every great man be a woman roll her eye a little too true and as Gallagher would add behind every great man be also an amazed mother in law Bruce be one of the more memorable comedy to have come out for quite a while and be probably the only directly religious that I can remember see that I be anxious to buy on to add to my personal collection it be a comedy write and perform in good taste but with enough relatively low brow humor to keep the kid entertain this be a meaningful comedy for the whole family which be become rare and rare these day in a world that be about to be flog with yet another American film and another Movie which be only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy it be nice to see that there be still people make comedy worth watching do n't miss this one",1

"this one and her Pilgrim be two of my favorite episode in this new version of Zone as I mention in my comment on the new series there be something lack in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that have to be learn it be a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than 's version however this episode can be consider as quite sentimental too I think the appeal be that no matter what they do the lover can never unite I remember I be n't surprise by the Korean movie Il Mare later remake into the Lake House I think it be because I see this episode first so it ruin the impact of the late film",1

"I find it hard to like anyone in this film the central character Lindy and Michael Chamberlain whose daughter disappear during a night out in the Australian outback be not bad people but then surely not all or even most of the score of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we know them good but though we be as sure as the film want us to be of the guilt or innocence of the from the start of their life 's tragic disarray the film take on a more or less sociological perspective pertain to gossip news medium crowd mob and assumption it be not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular it be merely an account of a true story that happen there Society en masse be much less evolve than the individual feel ensure that we be when a warden insist upon kill all of an aborigine 's dog because of the unverified action of a single wild dog when a randomly ruin life spin even further out of control owe to the majority of magazine newspaper and TV program distort the tragic truth to a level of drama that provoke its consumer into a frenzy there be no sign of empathy or even any kind of look outside of one 's own unaware perception influence left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one 's life the reason I appreciate the film be because it turn the focus inside out from the victim to the mass the evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside suspicion be jet fuel mostly by a virtue of hers To the public eye she do not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter why be she able to keep her cool even a sort of aloofness let alone hold her head up for TV and the press How much of the downward spiral could have be prevent have she behave more to the public 's liking in the medium Meryl Streep one of if not the great actress work today may not give a performance that particularly stand out and frankly neither do any other actor or department of film make but she and the screenwriter do understand Lindy What be infuriate be that it be not that difficult apparently she be not naturally prone to show emotion in public in any case whether or not she be approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense we be naturally prone to sympathize with her situation whether or not her performance be as immediately gratifying as Sophie 's Choice The Wear Prada Angels in America or other such work it be a triumph it be difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insight into yourself she frustrate us because we do n't know what she be think or feel it take me awhile to feel endear toward her but this be the movie 's way of suggest the reaction of the public 's attention she be marry to a pastor and they both practice a religion that be in a small minority and thus misinterpret by most initially they react to their loss as if to be reconcile themselves to God 's will kick start a rumor mill generate the notion that their daughter 's death be some sort of ritual kill on their part whatever happen to the little girl her parent be part of a margin with whom most of the medium 's intake do n't immediately identify so the first inclination be to go after them like a pack of hungry well Meryl Streep and Sam Neill be constantly on screen but the Australian public play the real lead here like punctuation for each plot advance director Fred Schepisi cut away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office where the public try Lindy and get carry away into their own passionate projection this Golan Globus docudrama be not particularly memorable the setting 's atmosphere do n't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stand out but it be very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public",1

"I manage to catch a late night double feature last night of before and before sunset and see both film in a row without really have the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately after sleep it over I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter and I shall explain why before introduce us with then young actor Ethan Hawke Dead Society only at the time of the film 's release and Julie the Three trilogy then although look much young he be a promiscuous American writer tour Europe after break up with his girlfriend she be a young French student on her way home to Paris they meet on the Budapest Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individual than spend a whole night together walk the beautifully capture street of Vienna exchange ideal and thought and gradually fall on love the film have be write all over it back then technology be leap rapidly the new millennium with all it be hope and dream be wait just around the corner and young adult like the one depict in the film be fill with love of life and passion for the future the character of Jesse Hawke and Celine with all their flaw and inconsistency Celine 's accent if by mistake or on purpose be half American half French and it swinge from one spectrum to the other breaking the character 's credibility be a mirror of the time watch the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement act all and romantic yet manage to have the audience fall for them as well be what really make this movie work for me the fact that the director do n't let you know if their relationship continue after the film or not make it all even more worth while all in all be a dreamy stroll through the urban landscape of Vienna a well tell classical romantic rendezvous and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future",1
"after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spend a single night stroll the street of Vienna discuss life and love the primary reason to see before be to watch a young Julie deliver her line as Celine this sexy brainy soulful brown eyed blond be sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they be in their mid twenty overstatement Celine be practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while be natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving we can easily forgive that she be a bit eccentric and talk a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remark be occasionally penetrate further her varied expression be nothing short of captivate and she speak English with a French accent that be very endear if there be a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and dishevel costar Ethan Hawke as Jessie come off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a Maynard G Krebs of the ninety to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drag himself through certain shot his pant fit poorly his tee shirt be come untuck his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature need a good washing and someone really should have show him how to properly trim his youthful goatee nevertheless he be suppose to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around Europe so the look he have cultivate be probably pretty genuine his oft cynical observation and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine although she be occasionally disturb by the extent of his alienation when he finally admit to her that he be utterly sick of himself and like be near her because he feel like a different person in her presence we know he be get somewhere after blow their collective fund on a series of cafe bar and silly diversion they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it Jesse bum a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass look up at the moon and the star and watch the sun come up give his boundless luck in the romance department it be especially irksome when Jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allow this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he content himself with a half bake plan quickly devise at the railroad station when he bid her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the appoint time come you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involve with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably wo n't show while Jesse who end up work at Target or if he be lucky the local library will go back to Vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone despite what for me be a very discouraging conclusion before be a beautiful movie I highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset",1
"when I see this movie in the theater when it come out in via a free advanced screening I be totally enchant and would have gladly pay to see it I be sorry when I talk to many people afterwards who have also see it and who be totally disappoint with it and how it end I on the other hand feel completely the opposite I be totally satisfy with the outcome and everything else people I talk to say there be too much talk Plus they be unhappy because they feel that the ending leave you wonder about the fate of the two character I find these observation to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie go public seem to have a tendency to want easy to follow storey in film with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confuse they also like to be spoon feed tidy ending happy Or sad This disgust me nobody want to be challenge anymore and as for the end and I do n't want to be a spoiler I be totally content because I know in my heart that these two character WILL see each other again it be all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny it be a very personal film that do n't speak to all people but it certainly speak to me give it a chance be patient with it Richard Linklater have craft a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna it make you feel as if you yourself be stroll through the city street along with the character as if you yourself be trip through Europe on a pass it be very intimate Plus Ethan Hawke and Julie do an exquisite job of bring the complex script to life they must have improvise during some part and it work well they have a great chemistry in their role their awkwardness as stranger get to know each other in the beginning be very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bond develop between them as the movie progress I get the feeling that this be a very personal work for Mr Linklater and I deeply respect him for get this film make it definitely touch me and I hope it touch other just as much Bravo for romance",1
"ever since I can remember and I be only my mother and I have be and continue to watch old movie because well I find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey do n't get me wrong I do love the movie we have today just not as much as I love movie of the and now I have to say the moment I start watch the movie my eye be glue to the TV of course my favorite character be the play by Lucile Watson but I love the way Betty Davis and her family be portray the child do not act like child in the slight but there be good reason for that have have to hide and run most of your life see the awful thing child see those day destroy their innocence so people say i hate how the kid act blah blah blah read between the line and know they see thing child should not see Paul Lukas dear Paul do an amazing job now I know many people be mad that he go the Oscar and Bogie do n't but hey they both do amazing job so I think it could have go either way but Lukas performance be so amazing that by the end of the movie I be reduce to tear I love this movie so much and recommend it to anyone cheerful",1
"this movie be intelligent that be more than most other movie it transcend the least common denominator stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also rely heavily on dialogue it have some parallel to in translation although before be much bright somehow less abstract and simply a lot well the script the character and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actor play absolutely brilliantly rarely have I see a movie where the script and the acting have melt this perfectly together the dialogue move into very personal issue with the risk of become a little over the top it do however stay on the right side almost all the time although I find a few moment a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demand outrageously talented actor sometimes it yield great result and overall this movie be simply stupendous only very very rarely be love in film depict in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic every time that be achieve the result be fantastic I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress help quite a bit in this respect she still look stunning in this film year after this be simply a gem of a movie that you ca n't miss one of the good movie I have see from the 1990s",1
"before have many remarkable thing go on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it be suffice to say that it be one of the most observant character study of the ninety maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love per say so much as it be about a human connection How do one fall in love at first sight no one do at least that be deep down the consensus that Linklater want to show with his film and yet there be the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that be young and with many idea that can be express articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and be somehow very tender and true at the same time Linklater here give us the story of Celine and Jessie a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train head to Vienna and on the way there start to talk about thing at first arbitrary then personal Jessie see death for the first time in his great grandfather Jessie persuade Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town in Vienna until his plane the next morning before give Jessie and Celine in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locale to go on and on about subject that have a lot of importance and in a sense be about the act of have conversation of what it be like to watch people have one lead into another and another here it be often about relationship and commitment as Jessie and Celine tell storey sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential quality we hear confession of desire for other love or what be n't really love of be part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you will love your life of what it mean to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I love the bit about the Quaker in the church and sometimes lace with cynicism or skepticism Jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what be fascinating about the film be that it be never exactly cynical itself just comment upon cynicism that lay in the concern of man and woman at that age of their life meanwhile it be always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie in these role where they be not incessantly annoy in that Generation X mode but be the kind of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which be n't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walk along the street of a city somewhere the conceit be that of an old romantic picture ala Brief only here intimacy be express in the central character either between each other where sweet aside be actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret Jessie say and then lean in for a kiss or in the little moment that pop up with other people along the way I love the scene with the poet where it be very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful word at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reaction from Jessie and Celine be that we might share but really be see them do it first hand All the while Hawke and embody the role interestingly we can see how neurosis be be form already for their adult life as it may lead off into the future splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it mean to have a moment of happiness however self contain as it may lead into something more who be to say you ca n't suddenly be attach to someone if only for less than hour and be that much more attach than a married couple this be perhaps Linklater 's thesis but there be more to it than just that it be a very dense film and one that will have me call back to it repeatedly One scene especially which be both cheesy and brilliant be when the two of them be talk on the phone in front of each other mimick their exposition might go to the other 's friend",1
"this be truly truly one of the good movie about love that I have ever see closely follow by none other than before sunset which technically be n't another movie at all since it be about the same two people and the same romance this be love in the real world OK that be only if most people be as intelligent and eloquent as the lead in the movie read the other review it please me to know how so many other folk be crazy over dialog base movie as well and this be what make before so good the dialog be perfect it be so real so engaging and funny it be hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love coz you fall in love with them at the very same time my favorite scene be the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to phone their good friend with the other pretend to be say well friend it be Perfect you back to the very moment when you fall in love for the very first time in your life I must say that if you have a choice do watch before before watch before sunset if like me you watch sunset first it be hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lover throughout the entire show once again the great romantic movie in my book act excellent script and beautiful location young love at it 's good",1

"many of the criticism on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with the Storm or Casablanca Everyone be entitle to compare film they choose but the similarity of the Storm and on the Rhine be clearly the problem of refugee threaten by the Nazi juggernaut while the main comparative point bring out with Casablanca be the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science because they choose Paul Lukas instead for the good Oscar it do not strike me as totally wrong Lukas have a good career in film both here and in England he be the villain in the Lady and this performance be his good one Bogart have more great performance in him than Rick Blaine for instance he be ignore for Sam Spade in the Maltese falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two year earlier both of which be first rate performance and he would not get an Oscar for his great performance as Fred C Dobbs in the Treasure of Sierra Madres the writer murder suspect in in a Place and Captain Philip Francis in the Caine afterward he get it for Charley in the African Queen I think that Bogie should have get it for the role of Dobbs but it do not happen but Lukas be lucky he get it on the define performance of his lesser career few can claim that To me the film to look at with on the Rhine be base on another play script by Hellman the Searching Wind they both look at America 's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s the Searching Wind be really look at the whole inter war period while on the Rhine set in the year just proceed our entry into World War II deal with a few week of time therefore it be well construct as a play and more meaningful for it be impact the film have many good performance lead by Lukas as the exhaust but determine anti Nazi fighter courier Davis as his loyal wife wisely keep her character as low key as possible due to Lukas be the center of the play 's activity as the selfish connive but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as wise and sad and feed up wife and Kurt who deliver a devastating critique as the local embassy 's Gestapo chief about and other who would deal with the Nazi it have dialog with bite in it and what it say be quite true it also have moment of near poetry witness the scene towards the end when be leave alone with Lukas and Davis and say the New World have leave the scene to the Old World Hellman could write very well at time give the strength of the film script and performance I would rate this film highly among World War II film",1

"I watch this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffle me how this do not have a distributor in the UK well actually it do n't because this film be everything a Hollywood film be n't original creative quirky and humorous it seem that today no one really want to see this type of movie as in the simple term it do n't conform to the generic convention most young viewer look for in a film I have n't write a review for the for age but feel incline to give this film a special mention even if it be during my minute break between class essentially it be about nothing as the two main character be plunge into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world the brilliance here be how the director sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two character and when the only mise en scene consist of half a house and a vast white empty space this be due in large part to the stellar performance of the actor both of whom offer some great laugh while at the same time be able to add significant emotional depth to their role I will love to write some more but am on quite a time limit However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try a very unique concept be bring to the screen in a coherent and well execute fashion with the combination of good performance a strong script nice sound design and fairly impressive visual create a very entertaining movie it be just a shame so few people know about nothing",1
"nothing be fantastic as that it be a film that should n't work yet do Natali stays in the realm of however this film be also a comedy Cypher it seem be a big budget drain affair for Natali at Woo Hoo Pa so with nothing he scale down again this be low budget independent film make at it be good good old fashion storytelling and an attempt at make a film for artistic merit as appose to Hollywood 's usual reason for mostly financial gain nothing be a film about nothing and before you ask no it be not anything like basically Andrew and Dave be a couple of loser they live in a strange look house beneath two freeway Andrew be a travel agent who be agoraphobic while Dave be Andrew good mate who stay with him rend free to help him out Dave be tired of it however and have a gorgeous girlfriend who he want to move in with by bizarre mi fortune however Dave find out his girlfriend embezzle a huge amount of money from Daves work place incriminate Dave and Andrew be wrongly accuse of sexually assault a girl scout Canadian humour people as it turn out Andrew 's house be to be demolish as well and he ca n't stop it happen as the house be build on land it should not have be build on both Andrew and Dave be inside the house when the police and the demolition team come call they be desperate and ca n't escape and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fade to white What have happen Have Dave and Andrew die they wake to find themselves still in the house only it be quiet no police no demolition team no angry girl scout mother What happen be Dave and Andy discover they have the ability to wish or hate away as it turn out they have hate away the entire outside world they be leave alone the house be surround by nothing which be portray as pure white so what this means be that the film setting be a house set and then just white the film be an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water they begin to tire of each other they discover they can hate away hunger which be useful but obviously thing get out of hand shall we say I ca n't reveal much but I must say bounce head be quite a sight to behold this film be quirky funny interesting the effect be simple yet effective and Natali bring together two buddy from David Hewlett and Andrew Millar to lead the film they have chemistry and also work very well they have to hold % of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background yet it work certainly I expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as Cypher do and it should appear on in a year or two in the state nothing be a top quality and unique film and although not as good as or Cypher it once again prove Natali as one of the well up and comer Natali be someone who have really interest me in his three feature so far and I can wait for his next feature I prey to god he do n't do the propose write and direct by sufferer the ever crap Paul Anderson Vincenzo old buddy if Paul come round to your pad Like the wind I hope and prey this guy do n't take to Hollywood like Alex do with the enjoyable yet pussy foot sugar coated helium light I keep your eye peel for this guy",1
"than this happy What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have work together on one movie this movie start with a touch of Brazil when at a certain point the story move straight into the twilight zone bring up nothing new but just nothing and nothing be great fun when Dave and Andrew start to explore their new environment the movie get really enjoyable bounce head well yes happy anyway this movie be the big surprise at this year 's just like in and Cypher Natali give this one a weird but very special design which make it hard to locate the place of the story or its time timeless somehow",1
"the premise of this movie have be tickle my imagination for quite some time now we have all hear or read about it in some kind of con text What would you do if you be all alone in the world What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappear in front of your eye in fact the last part be actually what happen to Dave and Andrew two room mate live in a run down house in the middle of a freeway system Andrew be a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave be consider be one of the big loser of society that alone be the main reason to why these two guy get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comfort be need just until Straight from the beginning of the film lot and lot of problem happen to them both of them get involve with crime Andrew suffer from paranoia and simply do n't dare go out of the house Dave be unsuccessful at his job and his colleague do n't treat him very well and with the respect he deserve the amount of problem they face keep increase until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this be just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that be exactly what happen the rest of the story place Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness at first they be surprised and have problem understand and deal with the feature of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seem as if they be the only one still leave nothing feature an incredibly small cast in fact besides the first couple of shot from the film we only see Dave David Hewlett and Andrew Andrew Miller in the entire film it be clear that in order to pull this off the cast have to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exist there be nothing that can distract the viewer in any way Vincenzo have decide to use a reasonable amount of close up head shot to make it more interesting and it actually work quite well Director of Photography Derek Rogers also have a nice way of tease the audience by withhold visual information especially at time where a character see something and react to it but we do n't see it right away obviously this ca n't be an event drive film and it be not much of the action happen outside their house when they move around in the void and that be where some of the most hilarious scene take place especially in the case of when Andrew discover a candy bar now one could be think How do nothing look like well it look like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing be white white no matter in what direction you look this be the weakness of this film after an hour or less it be get extremely boring to look at and there have to be event to make sure it be more interesting to look at thank God there be some for example at time when the two lad due to the property of nothing be able to jump really high as if nothing be make out of tofu as Andrew claim it be fun to see how they be instantly able to use nothing to become god of their own little society One of the good part of the film be the set production designer have do a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guy live be so unnaturally fun to look at still it seem right for these two to be live in a place like this All in all the production design be with no doubt one of the most powerful aspect of this film at it really make the film worth watch however the very good part of the film be the act both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actor they both be the camera be on them for every second of the film and as previously say there be just about no prop in the film they be really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent one liner clever dialogue at time hilariously stupid it all work to that end and this really move the movie away from the low budget area to well craft handwork let be talk a little about the visual effect because they be definitely worth mention nothing feature digital visual effect and prosthetics that equal any modern horror film there be a rather horrify dream sequence in the film and although the Drews have milk that scene completely it be still fun to watch One of the well visual effect in the film be at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their power in this environment they have the ability to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make thing appear nothing be a bright and well light movie it really help promote the idea of them probably be dead this be in fact one of their theory but nothing be a comedy and it slowly destroy its own theory we do n't know where they be or what have happen to them we do n't know if they will ever get out because the movie end before we see anything like that the ending by the way be not as good as it could have be it be rather easy to predict what be go to happen still the writer have think up a few incident that help make it a little more interesting and in the end it be a reasonably satisfactory one take Hollow Man Kill Bill and lot of other film and you have nothing it really be an amalgam of different style still there be no other film at least that I know of nothing be really like for the people remember the original production commentary on its may remember that Vincenzo Natali talk about how he come up with the story of he talk about him and have be room mate at a time and they both be in this extremely dull room with no hope of get out nothing could very well be the screen version of the origin of the story and to that end it be almost like one of the What can I say I enjoy nothing it be a great movie and the different part of the movie be extremely well make with ton of intelligent idea still I feel the movie be miss something and I have problem find out precisely what it be maybe if we have a Nothing 2 I can answer that question nothing be a great film but not as good as I expect it to be final rating 7 5",1
"I be n't sure what to expect but be I glad I go to see this a smart slightly twisted comedy that make you think I be n't quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to Mr Natali and the brilliant individual at C O R E to create another low budget set that look real as real as nothing can be well worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this please go you will be glad you do",1
"just see this at the Vancouver International Film Festival and it be funny as hell and a bit surreal Takes place in Toronto where these two loser live in this run down house in the middle of a freeway system David Hewlett Pin Cypher and Andrew Miller be just great as the two loser who wish the world would just go away the act dialogue and writing be very good and the whole film look great for such a low budget flick Director Writer Vincenzo Natali be in attendance at this screening and he seem so intelligent and down to earth this guy be so inventive with these great storey that work so well within small budget it put big budget Hollywood crap to shame",1
"Charlie Kauffman have make weird metaphysical angst popular but this Canadian gem make it hilarious like most weird film the less say about plot the good but let have set the scene two friend Anthony and Dave have be together since childhood they ca n't cope with the world and eventually this mean they no longer have to but that be where even more problem begin I love this film it make me smile long after the final credit and that be a rare experience with so many mass produce piece of nothing out there do n't miss this",1

"passport to Pimlico be a real treat for all fan of British cinema not only be it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it be a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitude and scenario sadly now only a memory in British life Stanley Holloway play Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discover a wealth of medieval treasure belong to the 14th Century Duke of Burgundy that have be bury deep underneath their little suburban street these last year accompany the treasure be an ancient legal decree sign by King Edward IV of England which have never be officially rescind to state that that particular London street have be declare soil which mean that in the eye of international law Pemberton and the other local resident be no longer British subject but native of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it 's own right and a law unto itself this set the war batter and impoverish resident up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of English law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration book destroy and ignore their clothing coupon flagrantly disregard British licence law etc declare themselves fully independent from Britain However what then happen be ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follow suit and cross the border into Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post war restriction to sell their dodgy good and half of London 's consumer follow them in order to dodge the ration make their quiet happy little haven a den of thief and a rather crowd one at that to Whitehall for assistance they be tell that due to development this be now a matter of foreign policy which his 's government be reluctant to become involve which leave the resident high and dry they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equip custom office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the resident of Pimlico eventually the border be close altogether start a major siege with the resident slowly run out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true British style as one resident quote we be English and we always be English and it be just because we be English we be fight so hard to be sentiment that be soon echo throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor plight they all feel compel to chip in and help them by throw food and supply over the barbed wire blockade Will Whitehall who have fight off so may invader throughout the century finally be bring to it 's knee by this new batch of foreigner especially as these one be English great tale and great fun throughout not to be miss",1
"my former Cambridge contemporary Simon today a writer and journalist have put forward the theory that just as British film maker in the eighty be often critical of what they call Thatcher 's Britain the Ealing comedy be intend as satire on Attlee 's Britain the Britain which have come into be after the Labour victory in the general election this theory be presumably not intend to apply to say Kind and which be if anything a satire on the Edwardian upper class or to the or the Lavender Hill both of which may contain some satire but be not political in nature it can however be apply to most of the other film in the series especially passport to Pimlico Pimlico be or at least be in the forty a predominantly work class district of London set on the North Bank of the Thames about a mile from Victoria station it be not quite correct to say as have often be say that the film be about Pimlico declare itself independent of Britain What happen be that an ancient charter come to light prove that in the fifteenth century the area be cede by King Edward IV to the of Burgundy This mean that technically Pimlico be an independent state and have be for nearly five hundred year irrespective of the wish of its inhabitant the government promise to pass a special act of Parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the Act receive the Royal the area remain outside the United Kingdom and British law do not apply because Pimlico be not subject to British law the landlord of the local pub be free to open whatever hour he choose and local shopkeeper can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the ration law when other trader start move into the area to sell their good in the street the British authority be horrify by what they regard as legalise black marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the Burgundian as the people of Pimlico have rename themselves to surrender many of the Ealing comedy have as their central theme the idea of the little man take on the system either as an individual as happen in the man in the White Suit or the Lavender Hill or as part of a large community as happen in Whisky galore or the the central theme of be that of ordinary man and woman take on bureaucracy and government impose regulation which seem to be an increasingly important feature of life in the Britain of the forty the film 's particular target be the ration system during the war the system have be accept by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against Nazism but it become increasingly politically controversial when the government try to retain it in peacetime it be a major factor in the grow unpopularity of the Attlee administration which have be elect with a large majority in and organisation such as the British League be set up to campaign for the abolition of ration I can agree with the reviewer who state that the main target of the film 's satire be the spiv black marketeer who play a relatively minor part in the action or the League who do not appear at all the satire be very much target at the bureaucrat who be portray either as have a rule for rule sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid have to take any action at all I suspect that if the film be to be make today it would have a different ending with Pimlico remain independent as a British version of Monaco or San Marino indeed I suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a TV sitcom rather than a film in however four year after the end of the war the film maker be keen stress patriotism and British identity so the film end with Pimlico be into Britain One of the well known line from the film be we always be English and we always will be English and it be just because we be English that we be stick up for our right to be Burgundian there be a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the of Pimlico all of which be present as be quintessentially British characteristic most of the action take place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after Pimlico have rejoin the UK the temperature drop and it start to pour with rain global warming may have alter thing slightly but for many year part of be British be the ability to hold the belief whatever statistic might say to the contrary that Britain have an abnormally wet climate the ability to make joke about that climate be equally important there be a good performance from Stanley Holloway as Arthur Pemberton the grocer and small time local politician who become the Prime Minister of free Pimlico and an amusing cameo from Margaret Rutherford as a batty history professor in the main however this be appropriately enough for a film about a small community pull together an example of ensemble act with no real star performance but with everyone make a contribution to an excellent film it lack the ill will and rancour of many more recent satirical film but its wit and satire be no less effective for all that it remain one of the funny satire on bureaucracy ever make and with the possible exception of Kind and be my personal favourite among the Ealing comedy",1
"every time this film be on the BBC somebody in the Radio Times say how it be a satire against the post war world of ration and the welfare state I do not think this be the point of the film at all the film parody the spiv small time criminal who run the blackmarket and the housewife league who campaign against government restriction but be really a Tory front organisation Yes of course the film send up the political social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the control to ensure a fair society they want to be British and muddle through rather than foreign but I do n't think they go back to be exactly like they be before",1
"I commend picture that try something different many film just seem like re tread of old idea so that be the big reason I so strongly recommend to Pimlico the movie be set just after and the post war shortage and ration seem to be drive Londoner barmy the film center on a tiny neighborhood in London call Pimlico they too be sick of not be able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it that be until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially name this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundred of year ago with this document they reason they can bypass all the ration and coupon and live life just as they want since it turn out they really British subject where the movie go from there and how the crisis be ultimately resolve be something you will need to see for leave it up the brilliant mind of Ealing Studios to come up with this gem",1

"when I really begin to be interested in movie at the age of eleven I have a big list of must see film and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them be not for all audience and my mother would go nut I remember one of the film on that list be a Line and could never get it so now to see it be a dream come true of course I lose the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there be some really interesting thing to watch there I mean take a Line a stage play turn into film I know it be something we see a lot nowadays but back then it be a little different apparently and this film have something special most of the musical make movie today take the chance the camera give them for free to create different scenery and take the character to different place a Line be bear on a theater stage as a play and it die in the same place as a movie follow a big audition hold by recognize choreographer Zach Michael Douglas Richard direct a big number of dancer as they try to get the job Everything happen on the same day the tension of not know the stress of have to learn the number the silent competition between the it all occur on the stage where Douglas put each dancer on the spotlight and make them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experience there be hundred of dancer and they be all fantastic but they list shorten as the hour go by like a movie I see recently a Prairie Home Companion the broadcast of a radio show here deal with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage thing be go on and time do n't seem to stop again I do n't if cut a lot to shoot this but it sure do n't look like it and anyway it be a great directing and edit John Bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder be what to do with the only one setting Ronnie Taylor 's cinematography find the way make close up to certain character zoom in and out show the stage from different perspective and also give us a beautiful view of New York in one crucial moment Douglas tell the one that be leave before we start eliminate you be all terrific and I will like to hire you all but I ca n't this make me think about reality show today where the only thing that count be the sing or dance talent and where the jury always say that exact word to the contestant before some of them be leave even when they be not good it be hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really be terrific To tell some of the storey the character use song and in one second the stage take a new life and it literally be a dream come true the music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyric by Edward make the theater to film transition without flaw show these dancer feeling and let them do those wonderful choreography by Michael Bennett the book in the theater also become a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman which be very touch at time so if it be not with a song it will be with a word but in a Line it be impossible not to be move during one of the rehearsal break in the audition Cassie a special dancer play by Alyson Reed take the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it the word let me dance for you never sound more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyric",1

"it take us a couple of episode to get into Dark Angel as a story and a series since we be from the a very different mentality framework but once we get with the gist of the series we be very quickly hook it be a shame that the series end just when it be just start to past good into the excellent category Dark much more than your average TV series it kick ass and rock as far as action go but the interaction of the character and societal reaction to mutant remind us of the constant prejudice that we face and make everyday that the story be set in the future keep the mood surreal and prevent the anti discrimination message from be rub in our face hence not ruin the fun for those who do n't like to be lecture during entertainment but every event and human societal interaction remain relevant to the present we all make judgment face our own prejudice but in the end the question of who you be lie in do you sit back and shut your mind to it or do you get up and do something about it for those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice this series empower them for those who have never have to face the question this series sneak in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment it be much more well make and well write than most TV series I be highly disappoint it end before it could really kick into high gear",1
"make by French brother Jules and and narrate by Robert De Niro and James Hanlon this be a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how New York 's fine shine on it 's dark day I first see this when I be a young naive year old and at that age it still touch me how serious 9 really be see this expand the whole effect of 9 we be find out who the hero be how there everyday life be compose and how they put their life on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their self these brave man put their life on the line and watch this just increase my admiration for them if you can this be the good documentary I have personally ever see",1
"the French brother do something nobody else do they have a video camera the day that this tragedy happen they be in Building 2 when you could see paper drift down people hit the ground from jump from such a height I mean it go as far as when both building collapse they go run their camera be still run when the white dust cover them they find a shop doorway and get inside but all this footage be real and I think they do a fantastic job of capture it for us Ten star go to the brother that film this extraordinary film that I watch every 9 so I will never forget what this country go through I believe if I remember right it show the first death of the priest of the firefighter while he be be carry to the church and his honorable funeral",1
"difficult film to comment on how do you say it be bad well it be n't but then it be equally difficult to say it be good What it be be compelling viewing it be as close as you will get to utter devastation without be there it be the photograph of the tsunami approach the coast of Thailand bring to life you know you want to turn away but you have to watch the brother handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstance there view on something which be happen in another country neither pander nor insult the fact be on the cellulose and little be need for the viewer to understand or comprehend what be go on you ca n't change history and you should not want this film stand as a testament to humanity in its dark hour",1
"I have read most of the comment here I come to the conclusion that almost everybody agree that 9 be a shocking piece of history there be a few who think that the added narrative be weak agree that the narrative be weak and unnecessary about two brother find each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about Tony but I do n't think narration be unnecessary like I lot of theorist I think that our own life be narration we be live and make our own autobiography so if we tell about our life this be always in the form of narration we do n't sum up fact like High School etc we create a story about our live because we be familiar with storey we want to put history in a story as well because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves we can well understand the thing happen in history when its tell in the form of a story so that be the purpose of add a story in documentary the story be weak so be it but we understand go on if it be me out there I would be worry sick about my brother and the second point make a blockbuster movie about it true it have be to recent to come up with a big movie about 9 though there have be a few about the subject but none of them like this documentary but what if there will be a movie in about 5 year I agree it be wrong try to make a lot of money out of 9 but I also agree that movie be one of the good way to tell history How many movie about the World war 2 have we see if I have not see these movie my view of the WW would me totally different I remember see List and I cry for an hour during class movie give you a good image of the thing that happen in history and although it be fiction it contribute to the memory of the disaster and the casualty so my point tell storey be not always bad it make us identify with the story and make us never forget what happen",1
"the event of September do not need extra human interest in the shape of follow the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brother in my view it would have be good to leave this out I think the director try too hard perhaps they feel that the event of the day need a story as a backdrop the comment of one of a policeman this f be apt nevertheless it be compelling viewing for the depiction of the event the be in all the right place at the right time no other footage from the day match what they shoot",1
"let me get the bad out of the way first James Hanlon be absolutely terrible try to act his description of what be go on with the rookie training and event of the day really it be in stark contract to the other fire fighter without act aspiration who be natural in their delivery that say it be an amazing film that be impossible to watch without tear in my eye I be an English guy from London but I love New York and have visit many many time before and after September 11th it be a second home to me and I ca n't help but feel devastate at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city this be the real deal in with the fire fighter with everything collapse around them I be so glad the footage exist to show people how it be on the day it be a shame that they do n't use any footage of people jump from the building because friend who be there tell me this be such a major part of their memory it should be include to show future generation just how terrible it really be theorist can go to hell by the way",1
"I live in Missouri so the direct effect of terrorism be largely unknown to me this bring it home that two man would put themselves on the line in the way that those member of and do just to document the horror that unfold on that day this film be a testament to those who lose their life and the true evil that terror bring",1
" and Jules want to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighter What they get be the only film footage inside the World Trade Center on September have work with James Hanlon 's ladder company before Jules go with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while stay at the firehouse in case anything interesting happen an airplane fly low over the City distract Jules and he point the camera up second before the plane crash into Tower One Jules ask the captain to follow him into the Towers the first thing he see be two people on fire something he refuse to film he stay on site for the next several hour film reaction of the firefighter and other who be there the brother take great care in not make the movie too violent grizzly and gory but the language from the firefighter be a little coarse and CBS show a lot of ball air it uncensored the brother mixed footage they film with one on one interview so the firefighter could explain their thought and emotion during particular moment of the crisis unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from sale go to 9 related charity Very well make emotional move and completely devoid of political propaganda be the good documentary of the sort to date",1
"I have to say that the event of 9 do n't hit me until I see this documentary it take me a year to come to grip with the devastation I be the one who be change the station on the radio and channel on TV if there be any talk about the tower I be sick of hear about it when this be air on TV a year and a day later I be bawl my eye out it be the first time I have cry since the attack I highly recommend this documentary I be watch it now on TV 5 year later and I be still cry over the tragedy the fact that this contain one of the only video shot of the first plane hit the tower be amazing it be an accident and look where it get them these two brother make me want to have be there to help",1

"incredible documentary capture all the frenzied chaos and misery which loom over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th personal and completely rivet 9 be perhaps the great documentary ever make by accident which kind of give it an even great appeal up until that morning filmmakers Gideon and Jules have be follow around a New York firefighter team concentrate specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they be shoot deal with the rigorous training to become a fireman out with the team that morning film yet another simple routine cleanup Jules lift his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only know image of the first plane hit the World Trade Center and from there a simple documentary be no more viewer be give a first hand account of what it be like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighter and one profoundly bewilder cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster without hesitation follow these automatically programme hero into the tower while it 's entire support crumble around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurk with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable be old brother Gideon 's candid capture of an entire city in the throng of a large and more palpable fear then anything they have collectively witness by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shield himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinse the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage capture obviously the filmmaker deserve only as much credit as be in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brother in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minute we witness them become like the fireman they document only instead of save life they know they have to save footage even if it cost them their own safety after view 9 and see that it come out in I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stone 's recent rendition the big budget World Trade Center Many have criticize the film for ignorantly narrow down the focus to those two survivor trap in rubble and although I enjoy the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it bring 9 all but render his film completely obsolete not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motive midway ensure that this documentary have all the heart and character need to never the event again",1
"To sum this documentary up in a few word be next to impossible every fiber of your body tell you that this be not happen right from the opening montage of rapid fire image through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero but every frame be real the story be think up by two French brother live in New York Jules and Gideon pronounce Nau day want to make a documentary on New York City begin with a from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full fledge firefighter seek the help of their close friend actor James Hanlon an actor and firefighter at Station

member of this close knit family firefighter have a superstition about it be that they be either White or Black meaning that with the latter all kind of fire follow the the former mean that very little fire activity follow but one day there will be the mother of all fire Tony be a White Cloud after some initial grow pain Tony settle into the firehouse as if he be a seasoned vet then the unthinkable occur September begin with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a suppose gas leak not far from Wall Street because Jules have have little camera experience Gideon hand a camera to his young brother and tell him to ride with the chief T K Pfeiffer at about 8 the firefighter begin to use their gas detector over a grate then the sudden roar of what seem to be a low fly airplane rip past the scene and as Jules pan upwards we see the first strike of the day American Airlines Flight smash into the face of the North Tower of 1 World Trade Pfeiffer order his man into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center once there Jules ask to accompany the Chief into the tower Pfeiffer tell to stick close to him once inside the full impact of the grow disaster begin to show on the face of the man whose sole purpose be to save live Gideon decide to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area once there he capture the impact of the second plane United Airlines Flight with 2 World Trade he know Jules be with Chief Pfeiffer inside the tower watch and capture the crowd reaction to the unimaginable Gideon begin to capture on tape the grow fear in Manhattan inside tower one Jules record the last view the world or love one will have of their son father uncle grandfather husband boyfriend friend as one by one each firefighter carry of equipment begin the long arduous climb up storey to rescue the injure and trap Jules also catch the last glimpse Chief Pfeiffer will have of his brother Kevin as he leave to do his selfless duty also catch on video be the sound of fall body hit pavement from victim choose to jump from the high floor above the impact zone sooner than face death at the hand of the flame and smoke but Jules be respectful never once do he capture a sensationalistic moment the money shoot his work be professional through his baptism of fire he also catch the sight of debris fall from tower two after it be hit by the second plane and the order way the firefighter evacuate civilian from the building then Jules be catch in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim be take Father Michael Judd the for the fire department then as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two tower one begin its structural collapse What result be a breathtakingly poignant view from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gideon work separately to document that day not know if either be alive each fear the bad as each firefighter arrive at the firehouse they greet each other with joyous hug at have make it back and in one moment of overwhelming emotion Jules and Gideon be reunite as Jules cry on his brother 's shoulder Gideon embrace his young brother as Hanlon make the filmmaker the subject there be one fearful moment when Tony who leave the station with a former chief be believe to have be lose but return to the fold this have prove himself Shown with only three interruption 9 be a stunning achievement in documentary filmmak it rank up there with the Hindenburg footage in show history as it unfold the be to be commend for their deft handling of the subject in lesser hand the tendency would be toward the sensational but the temper their eye toward dignity and compassion by Hanlon we get the feel of his word as he take the audience through the event of September Robert De Niro host the program in a sombre restrained way he never seek the camera for his own glory rather he lay out the scene you be about to see I also commend CBS for their bravery at air this special for their attempt at grab rating they temper their edit toward the emotion of the relative of those who perish this be a must see for anyone who need to be remind of what true heroism be it be n't about dribble a basketball or sell an album of hate lyric 9 be about humanity at its good heroism at its fine and the cost of freedom",1
"this be the most visually stunning move amazing and incredible story I have ever experience quite frankly even those adjective just can describe it I ca n't just choose one scene that stand out for me I suppose if I have to list a few it would be the reaction of the fireman to the crash sound of jump victim the reaction of people trap in the elevator who be unaware of what be go on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlooker and finally the silence on that day and even now I be remind of Star Wars Obi Wan say ` I feel a great disturbance in the Force as if million of voice suddenly cry out in terror and be suddenly silence it be amazing how it be so accurate in its description there be truly a disturbance in the Force this documentary vividly reveal this disturbance the feeling be so incredibly visual the anger the frustration the shock the fear the exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude it be all there not a thing be miss this be a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the Emmy not just because it document 9 but because it be simply everything it should be if you plan to watch be sure to grab a box of tissue you will need them I know that I do",1
"To those who say that this movie deserve anything below the grace that it show I disagree this be an amazing documentary about a shocking day ask us to rate this movie I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary be make the courage that it take to shoot this film be most notable we find that the two brother be split up when that moment happen they continue to document the brave of the brave without know about their own and 's safety To judge whether it be noble to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the life as those amazing amazing firefighter do be not mine to answer I just know that in year a class full of child will not know one without the other I submit a wholehearted this be why the art of film be create To capture the natural emotion that real life offer you can keep your kung fu junk Romance be cute Action will never reach this level this movie 9 will be timeless in that it do not glorify itself it do n't have a sneak peek it do n't have all of the blatant vanity that a lion 's share of the many movie on the many screen blare it have class composure substance and it have a record of the day that change the modern face of America and even the world it speak of thing inescapable to the eye of the camera please consider this movie as it itself proclaim a stir tribute to all of those who fall because of the free beautiful name of America How can you give anything less to a movie that show not embellish the natural bravery of real people act in unreal time I love the but 9 be forever a different kind of movie as this be now a different kind of world it be art without question or question",1

"warn Yes I realize it be tough to spoil an historical documentary but I do reveal some of the and method this be an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage but also due to the story behind it because the do not set out to tell the story of 9 but rather that of a rookie firefighter the man 's emotion and the viewer 's connection with them be more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective in a filmmak sense 9 be textbook if the event be an actual script they would be superb as the character be establish then throw a curve to which they must react this be all the more amazing consider the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the director have to wade through to piece this story together the first portion of the film provide a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically how a rookie assimilate himself into a crew of veteran that part alone be quite good and have the documentary be allow to run its intended course it probably would have be solid the brother appear to realistically portray the process of become a NYC firefighter then of course all hell break loose the chaos follow the WTC attack be vividly see as various character that we have get to know be thrust into terrifying situation see not only the attack but also the first hand reaction be a very move picture of extreme human emotion the aftermath in which firefighter be discover to be lose and find be human drama at its peak life and death hang in the balance unlike many movie the viewer not only do n't know who will live and die but genuinely care about them the only negative thing I have to say about this be that the Robert DeNiro whom I like blurb be uninformative unnecessary and do n't advance the story at all they be probably add just to attract more television viewer Bottom Line the good documentary I have ever see nonpareil portrayal of raw human emotion and drama 9 5 out of",1

"I borrow this movie despite its extremely low rating because I want to see how the crew manage to animate the presence of multiple world as a matter of fact they do n't at least so its seem some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie that be it this be what the majority of viewer think however the surprise come at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewer have already stop this movie I be also astonish when I see that the Brazilian Portuguese title of this movie mean into Death this be the spoiler that this movie be about a young girl who go onto this boat on reason that be completely unclear you understand only in the last 5 minute when you start the movie with the English title Boat in your head you clearly think that the cameo appearance of strange figure be the ghost but in reality this movie be not like most other horror movie tell from the distant writer watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different level of reality it be tell from the perspective of the young girl we see her not alone but together with the four friend because see them we do not see that she be alone so the parallel world be not the cameo appearance flicker into the picture stream but the main story we have at least two parallel world the world in which the girl be and the world in which the 4 friend be an intrusion of a third world be probably the young man with the medical skill who come for a short time on the boat I can get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie the movie maker cheated an audience of several thousand people by let them believe that what they have do be more or less a sophomore film student elaborate with hastily choose pseudo actor that have meet just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beer How mistake can one be but in addition to this big surprise which one learn only in the very last minute the end that follow give another surprise the girl be save by a crew in a helicopter and another boat when she have recover from her shock she visit again the place at the harbor where she ascend the boat together with the four friend and there they be again they wave her to them from the boat which have already take off shore she jump into the water arrive at the boat and they be away miraculously beautiful it remember me a bit to the end of a poem by a writer when I awake I see death standing at my bed but I close my eye when I open them again he be go",1
"I also see this upon its release in and have be strike since then with its final scene if this be an answer to High Noon then it be an apt and apposite response the notion that as this string be head the town come together be a much strong message than the lonely personal heroism of High Noon in this theme Concho be a phenomenal precursor of one my other all time favorite the Seven both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performance especially Sinatra 's transformation from bully kid brother to liberate town savior I can only hope that at some point all the friend and family on whom over the year I have inflict my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves",1
"I be lucky enough to get to see this film many year ago in England I have see hundred of film since but I have never forget this one although Sinatra be play a not very endear character he be excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he really come into his own until his role in from here To but in my opinion he be magnificent in Concho the other role that stick in my mind be that of William Conrad I will never see or hear of him before this film Conrad play a terrific part in this film I remember his deep and gravelly voice and he use it beautifully to enhance the few word he speak with a menace that set the tone of his character also I remember the music that both introduce Conrad and and seem to surround him whenever he appear an excellent film and my only disappointment be that I never ever get the chance to see it again it seem to have disappear from the face of the earth I see in the title that it say that the film be in black and white but when I see it be indeed in full color I remember Sinatra 's blue shirt",1

"look back over the past year since my first exposure to the show all i can say be once you get it it will stay with you forever I remember my initial reaction be 1 annoyingly overact 2 under produce 3 two year later I watch some episode again and do n't find it nearly as annoy a year later I be able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly become engross in it 's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspective on happiness Yes the show have a style that be not for everybody and I be sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now but I still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eye longing for what seem like simple time I be a married man for all who think this be a show for female",1
"British comedy tend to fall into one of two main type the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire setting character and concept vary but certain characteristic place the vast majority of show into one of the two category be perhaps the of the first type the script be very verbal include long interior monologue by the main character Ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have miss out on when she embark on a thoroughly conventional life when she meet a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who make his interest in her quite clear she toy with the idea of find out what the other path might have offer the act and script be always on the money which make one 's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one I be neither blow away by it nor turn off my mother on the other hand adore this show I think the degree to which one identify with Ria 's dilemma be the most important factor in determine one 's reaction to",1
"Johny To make here one of his good style exercise make a strong film with a good yakuza 's story the election of the new yakuza 's boss be the beginning of a war inside the organization in my opinion the violence be wise use in the context make a very strong gang film I specially love the way he tell the history move around all the role inside the yakuza 's family and make that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problem talk about the technical aspect the film be a good example of pause and way of shoot a film One of the Hong Kong Films of the year be like infernal affair but without the easy action violence scene and the confused storyline strongly recommend to all Asian film lover sorry for my English well do in Spanish",1
"enjoy the movie and efficient Confucian crime drama the old order survive the threat pose by a brash young greedy man no doubt represent modern society I think the final scene be strange and could not understand if we be to believe that big D be be punish for be greedy or it be part of the plan a long I love the scene and for once in a Chinese movie the violence be not a choreograph martial art fest on thing that always amuse me about HK film be that the main influence the British seem to have have be to introduce yes sir and sorry into the local language and its amuse that long after we have go they be still there",1
"election be a Chinese mob movie or triad in this case every two year an election be hold to decide on a new leader and at first it seem a toss up between Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai or as I know him the other Tony Leung and Lok Simon Yam who be Judge in Full Contact Though once Lok win Big D refuse to accept the choice and go to whatever length he can to secure recognition as the new leader unlike any other Asian film I watch feature gangster this one be not an action movie it have its bloody moment when necessary as in but it be basically just a really effective drama there be a lot of character which be really hard to keep track of but I think that play into the craziness of it all a bit a year old baton which be the symbol of power I mention before change hand several time before thing settle down and though it may appear that the film end at the or minute mark there be still a couple big surprise wait Simon Yam be my favorite character here and sort of anchor the picture election be quite the award winner at last year 's Hong Kong Film win for good actor Tony Leung well picture good director Johnny To who do Trio and good screenplay it also have nomination for cinematography edit film score which I love and three more acting performance include Yam",1
"first off I must say that I make the mistake of watch the election film out of sequence I say unfortunately because after see Election 2 first election seem a bit of a disappointment both film be gangster epic that be similar in form and while election be an enjoyable piece of cinema it be just not nearly as good as it be sequel in the first election installment we be show the two competitor for Chairman Big D and Lok after a few scene of discussion amongst the Uncle 's as to who should have the Chairman title they almost unanimously decide that Lok Simon Yam will helm the triad suffice to say this do n't go over very well with competitor Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai and in a bid to influence the takeover Big D kidnap two of the uncle in order to sway the election board to his side this have disastrous result and head the triad into an all out war Lok be determine to become Chairman but wo n't become official until he can recover the Dragon Head Baton a material representation of the Chairman 's power the current Chairman Chung Wang have hide the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race be on to see who can recover it first much of the film be devote to the recovery of the Baton as both aspiring leader search for it they must dodge cop and opposite side which lead into one of the stand out scene in election which involve an underling name Jet Nick Cheung a machete and lot of bad guy Nick Cheung 's presence be attention grab to say the least I wonder if this influence director To in any way while make the second election as he do deliver more of Jet 's character in the sequel while Nick Cheung give a scene steal performance I must not fail to give due to the rest of the film 's actor election have a great ensemble cast with well think out performance that be both subtle and impact Simon Yam be his usually glorious self and the film also benefit from heavyweight HK actor like Louis Koo Tony Leung Ka Fai and the under appreciate Suet Lam there really be n't any weak link in the acting and one could easily believe that they be watch real gangster although the performance be great one of the most impressive thing about Election be Johnnie To 's eye for the camera there be some truly striking shot in the film and it go without say that To definitely know how to frame his shot as the viewer be treat to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera and angle all of which make election above all a great look film my issue with the film arise mostly out of the shear amount of character involve in Election it get a bit hard to follow because the film be so full of character that be n't integral to the plot while the sequel opt to focus more on the two candidate the first election offer the election process as a whole with ton of underling and police officer crowd the storyline maybe the film would have work good if it would have be a bit longer with more time dedicate to the inner working of the Triad or if Director Johnnie To would have funnel down the necessary element and expound on them more Bottom Line All in all this be a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast excellent direction and leisurely pace that pack a punch it be just a little more complicated than it need to be",1
"it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describe a film in term of other film but I think it be the good way to give an approximation of the place election occupy in the gangster genre arena it work somewhere in between the and Kinji 's yakuza opus the yakuza Papers Aka Battles without Honour and in that it be simultaneously both romanticize and realistic dark and gritty but it be also a Johnnie To film and as such it carry the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur every two year the HK Triad elect a new boss only this time one of the candidate be not overly happy with the result so he decide to take matter into his own hand much to the dismay of the rest of the triad and the police that be the story in a nutshell but rest assure it have a lot more go for it than that as in the yakuza Papers there be a great deal of scheme back stab and form and switch of allegiance sometimes all it take be a phone call in one of the most memorable scene I have see in recent time which might not necessarily make for deep drama but make for an interesting plot and good character conflict fan of the gangster genre be likely to appreciate it in that aspect election be not as action orient as one might expect although it be violent and I be not talk about the glossy glamour version of Hollywood violence this be dark and grim To 's camera linger in the scene of people be brutalize in way that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrator and victim after all violence be an integral part of us whether we like it or not if you be familiar with To 's style then you should know what to expect the pace be relatively slow and deliberate the cinematography be great slick and dark in equal measure utilize dark hue brown dark green and orange while the smooth tracking shot add a vibrant quality to it in the end election occupy a peculiar place it be not exactly a character study and it be not an action oriented gangster film it explore a situation the election and its aftermath but do so in style and be both realistic and romanticize the Triad ceremony in particular echo of an oriental",1
"I always think this would be a long and boring talk Heads flick full of static interior take dude I be wrong Election be a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama take a deep and realistic view behind the origin of character be constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider it be still possible to feel the suspense come from certain decision and ambition of the character furthermore Johnnie To succeed in create some truly opulent image due to meticulously compose lighting and atmospheric light shadow contrast although there be hardly any action the ending be still shocking in it be ruthless depict of brutality Cool movie that deserve more attention and I come to like the acoustic guitar score quite a bit",1
"personally I find the movie to be quite a good watch it outline the actual situation of triad in Hong Kong and give the viewer a glimpse of how triad be organize not only that it also show the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police do n't just go all out and wipe out triad overall the movie be rather violent due to the gangland method of killing torture nevertheless the movie stay true to the real world thus the violence on screen be just a reflection of what really happen I will recommend this movie to any Triad Mafia movie fan another good watch would be Dragon that movie have more gun than this as in this movie there be more knife than gun in fact I do n't remember see a single gun",1
"this film really deserve more recognition than its get it really be a stunning and rich portrayal of blood tie favour and allegiance within the crime world the film be shoot beautifully and delve into all you be classic crime theme such as betrayal and power this film be a movie goer film it require attention and understanding and reward fully in the end it be the godfather of hong and be a welcome change rather than another wire frame fight martial art epic which seem to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong and china it feature an arrangement of great character actor and development although be fair to say I have to watch it twice just to nail what be happen with some of the character due to their be so many interaction in the film in all 8 great plot character but there be character that do n't stand out enough and the music do n't really get me go and at time i feel it do n't sync well with the action there be action by the way so it lose some point for that",1
"I must admit I be expect something quite different from my first viewing of Cut last night though be delight with the unexpected Australian horror gem I be a true horror fan as true as they come and find cut to not only be the good of the genre Australia have ever produce but one of the great parody comedy film of late my only concern be that mainstream audience may not pick up on a lot of the comedic element the film be not overly clever in it 's application but make me laugh at every turn try to fit in Every possible cliche of the horror genre they could I be certain this be intend as humour hope this be intend as humour and of course there be the gore the use of the customise garden shear be brilliance besides the expect stab and slash in short there be a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent death enough to please even the skeptic of this film worth the appearance of both Kylie Minogue short that her appearance be and Molly Ringwald be just another reason to see the film both performance be fantastic as well as Simon The Castle in a brilliant role as the technician all in all I think this movie be one of the good horror product of the last couple or year as well as a beautiful satire parody in cheek till the very end love it go see it",1

"I see this movie with a bunch of friend and although only two of us walk out of the cinema thinking how cool it be the other just laugh and comment on how stupid it be well that be because it be n't suppose to be take so seriously basically it be a a movie that mock horror flick and do a damn good job there seem to be another movie come out like that too Movie well this be Aussie and original Jessica Napier do a performance and Sarah have a bright future in act I hope to see more of them Molly Ringwald be a good move and Kylie be an even well move the Princess be Queen of the screen I recommend see this flick as you will be guess until the very end the connection with Hilary and the movie that never get finish year ago",1

"it be n't the bad film ever make the actor be n't and the script and director be not completely inept it be n't the good film ever make the actor be n't excellent and the script and director be not completely brilliant it fall somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well construct somewhere no need to say do n't take it seriously or so bad its good or it be n't scary none of these comment be relevant Cut have atmosphere it be that atmosphere which be actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally be what make the film for me",1
"this be not a bad movie it follow the new convention of modern horror that be the movie within a movie the well know actress run for her life in the first scene this movie take the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it be also always nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack so this might be an example of what the genre have become Cut hit all the mark and be actually scary in some part I like it I give it an eight",1
"for a slasher flick this movie be actually good than a lot in the genre yes it be predictable resident nut job go on kill spree people die however there be some good positive in this film first off i really like the mask the nut job wear it be definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique although i have n't watch every single slasher film ever make also the genesis of the bad due be something i have n't see before and he way he finally meet his end be a novel concept as far as i know i also really like the weapon of choice employ by Mr for most of the murder the murder themselves be not as graphic as most in the genre but small concern the movie do not take itself seriously which be something most slasher suffer from oddly enough while watch the movie i be remind of the early Friday the 13th film which do take themselves seriously there be a few concern about this movie in several scene the killer suddenly bear a strong resemblance to one of our horror icon by this i mean his movement and his reaction upon be shoot and also the way he walk of big concern however be a scene very close to the end where Mr crazy bear a more than striking resemblance actually a complete rip off of another famous horror titan and in the very last scene we have our scumbag once again look exactly like the 1st horror icon i mention in fact that last scene be almost a complete rip off from another icon in the slasher genre these scene be weak and unoriginal obviously by the way the movie be set in Australia so if you be a sucker for a chick with an Aussie accent like me you will be in heaven if you not than it just might grate on you one other great thing about this movie beautiful Kylie just do n't get too attach to her there be one non Aussie accent courtesy of Molly Ringwald overall there be more reason to watch than not i enjoy it and have some fun so i have to give cut 8 which may seem too high to some people",1

"What would you expect from a film title present as festive fun something like Ghandi or English patient there be lot of thing I love about this film it be funny it be very well cast and it be superbly write I come to the film as a Kaplan fan but be dubious when I read the plot it sound ridiculous but the film do n't come across like that because Affleck as Drew Latham play his part perfectly one minute a child like adult the next a mature man who realise he have gain everything in life apart from what he really want in fact we see Latham grow up in this film when he encounter the problem of those he envy and realise that their life be not so good he see that his own lot be not so bad this film have few weak or dud scene than many other comedy I have see comedy be so much hard than any other type of drama it either work or it do n't and very few comedy writer get it correct every time I particularly love the drama scene where the family take to reading part write by Latham the pleasure be in the reaction of Tom James and the comment of Brian Josh Zuckerman it be the dilemma of the greedy Tom who have to bite his tongue wear silly hat or sing to the Christmas tree in order to earn the prise money that keep the film move along well the addition of daughter Alicia Christina Applegate into the story bring a delightful romantic angle and why not in a Christmas film of course its corny and contrived he be rich and handsome she be beautiful and single and so inevitably her and end up fall over together in the snow and find themselves face to face Great One thing I would have like be more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I ca n't really complain I get what I want",1

meditate on the concept of geographical cultural political and personal border consider himself a historian of twentieth century Greece and he like to bring lesson from the Hellenic myth into his discussion in this film he do some border cross himself between the Greek and Italian culture draw from a combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition of Odysseus travel Alexander be a in search of a

"this be definitely one of the good kung fu movie ever and may be one of the good movie ever it have get a great plot that function like a puzzle with lot of intrigue and suspense this film be full of cat and mouse game and deception with people hide their identity and their nature the character in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie character they be all interesting and compelling and the movie do a good job at give them scene to show their personality 's and desire the fight scene play out like little storey and many of them be very original and exciting it have cool training sequence and martial art skill that be so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy there be 5 member of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimic the special skill of a venomous animal the style of each of these character be fun to watch and you can see the technique they use in training apply during the film when this happen the director use quick cut back to the training scene to draw a parallel these cut be accompany by music change and sound effect and the whole thing really work nicely One thing about this movie that be very original be the way it treat death the director Chang be obviously very concern that the film not trivialize death this make some of the scene in the movie much more effective we actually care when people be kill in this film this be because the camera linger on the horror of death even when the bad guy be kill some of the sequence in this movie be truly gut wrench when character go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain at the same time this be also a fun movie it have all the typical thing you expect from a traditional kung fu film there be bad dub the character be willing to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effect be hilarious and at time the behavior of the character be incredibly unrealistic all this just add to the greatness of the film and let not forget that this director be a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporary if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display be Everything go by so fast because of the quick cut style and the rapid camera movement of the genre that it be easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really be the lighting and composition be spectacular at time the camera work and movement be extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast pace edit in the scene that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine Hitchcock move at about twice the speed Chang be truly a master craftsman and artist who know his genre and be able to produce important material while work within it 's confine he do n't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skill permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work he be an important filmmaker who continue to influence many people this be the real package a kung fu movie that deliver on every level it be art it be trash it be emotionally move and it be fun it have a true sense of morality but do n't allow that morality to get in the way of deliver good action I recommend it to everybody whether you be a fan of this genre or not",1
"I would give this show a ten out of ten if it be not for the fart joke you people be so damn sensitive it be inane so quick to point out the racism of the show and the joke yet be also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig head crap like well some of these other show do these joke so much good because at least they have hot woman so disgusting abortion joke be great because really who take abortion seriously anyways at least I be not a bore son I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman be team up to do a movie about sister take a road trip together talk about a movie of the year",1

"the Sarah Silverman program be good than those other show no laugh track no painful joke just a program the Sarah Silverman program if you be like me and you love comedy this be probably a show for you Sarah Silverman bring out there funny and right here funny to the table with ease a mix of different style which make for its own This program be n't something you want to start a compare war with see as how it have absolutely nothing to do with them other show this show be its own entity and i think most comedy head will like it just fine go watch and see",1
"good show since she be really really funny her total self the hulking gay stoner neighbor the departure into song or cartoon make this the fresh show on TV One of the few show I make point of watch the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore oh wait now that you be close you do look old turn face with finger and walk away the cough syrup overdose sleeping with God it be all so funny or so stupid it be just a lot of fun the show weak point be her sister and the cop only because they be too darn normal I really ca n't wait until the next show something I have n't feel for any show in a long time",1
"the Sarah Silverman program be very similar to Sarah 's own stand up it be so over the top with prejudice that you ca n't possibly take it to heart the fact be though that while most all people will get it it do n't mean they will all appreciate it it be a very polarize and one dimensional show so if you do n't like it after minute you may as well give up there if you do like it after minute stay tune because every episode thus far have be as good as the last like all show though it be not perfect personally I love the program but there be some huge fault with it racist song be funny but get old a lot faster than Silverman seem to realize a problem that I have with Jesus be Magic as well it seem as if Silverman give herself a quota for song per episode that do n't need to exist not to mention that while the lyric to the song she write be good the music well be n't another thing to keep in mind be that while this show will for some reason appeal to fan of Monty Upright Citizens brigade etc it be nothing like those show I can watch Monty all day but as much as I like this show I ca n't watch more than the half hour limit at a time it get flat very fast the repeat value for this show be low too the second time around an episode be fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion it be bore still that first time around be very very funny give it a shot",1
"follow a sitcom plot be so mindlessly easy that have her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit be the kind of experimentalism that sitcom could really use the support character grind the show in a sitcom reality which provide a contextual counterpoint to Sarah 's erratic persona which beyond general insensitivity have no specific recur trait for expectation to be base on make her less a character than a canvas to be repaint in every episode if not scene Sarah 's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enable her to parody aspect of social behaviour that be subtle enough to usually go unnoticed every time she speak it be like a self contain 5 second skit she a lot demonstrate the countless thing a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify but never stick with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectation that will be satisfy this may be the most creative original and experimental TV program ever",1
"first and foremost I would like to say that I be a huge Sarah Silverman fan and have other people say that and then rag on the pilot be beyond me Everything in the pilot be in typical Sarah Silverman form maybe not directly funny but the situation and the delivery be what count if you like Jesus be Magic then I do n't see how you would n't like this it have that same flow and that same rhythm true it be only for the true fan but if you be you will be please again only for the true fan there be no way around that if you be not use to her style then you would n't get why this be funny However it be and I hope you think so too",1

"watch make me nostalgic for the early a time when virtually every new action movie could be describe as die hard in a on a be die hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it be but unlike Passenger and under which be decent die Hard clone on their own term dispense with the enclose feeling of many action movie and embrace breathtaking landscape that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflict of the people fight and die among the peak year before other movie like a Plan and Fargo dramatize crime and murder on snowbound location director Renny Harlin recognize the visual impact of juxtapose brutal violence and grim struggle to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings the opening sequence have already receive substantial praise all of which it deserve its intensity allow us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actor and simply believe that what we be see be actually happen not even Harlin 's shot of the fall stuffed animal which be powerfully effective but still threaten to become too much of a joke and which he repeat in Deep Blue Sea or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite 's face can dim the sequence 's power the next impressive set piece be the gunfight and heist aboard the jet as write by Stallone and Michael France and direct by Harlin the audience be plunge into the action by not initially know which agent be involve in the theft and which be not the bloody double crosse be completely unexpected as Roger Ebert have observe the stuntman who make the mid air transfer between the plane deserve some special recognition Later during the avalanche sequence one of the terrorist thief appear to be actually fall as the wall of snow carry him down the mountain so far as I know no one be kill in the making of this movie a small miracle consider the extreme nature of some of the stunt so obviously a dummy be use for the shot but the shot itself remain impressive because we be left wonder how Harlin or more likely one of the second unit director know exactly where to place the camera I will take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he be one of the few movie star I have ever see who be completely convince as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feel that pain the role of Gabe Walker really complement Stallone 's act strength he play an old more vulnerable kind of action hero give an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself in contrast to many of today 's post comic book inspire action hero Stallone 's Walker be an ordinary man who become a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced ability in the hero almost freeze to death and his clothes start to show big tear as he barely escape one dangerous situation after another he wince when he be hit and bleed when he be cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he take a Rocky style pummel from one of the mad dog villain it should be note that the utterly despicable villain really contribute to the movie 's effectiveness when I first see this movie as a teenager I be root for the good guy every step of the way and anticipate when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point I actually cheer as one of the most cold blooded character in the movie deservedly suffer a violent demise Lithgow 's British accent be as unconvincing as the movie 's occasional model plane or model helicopter but he be fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene look at his hostage Stallone and Rooker try to decide which task to give them he actually say you stay you fetch even a good actor such as Anthony Hopkins might have have trouble with that line even if occasionally toss credibility aside it do so only for the sake of a more entertaining show early in the movie for example Lithgow openly say to one of his man Stallone when he come down no real criminal mastermind would have make this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allow Rooker to shout a warning up to Sly on the rock face and this precipitate a gripping tug of war between Stallone and the bad guy try to pull him down by the rope tie to his leg Lithgow could have give his order by a more subtle mean but the sequence might not have be as much fun to watch if it have n't give Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or at time a Western be build on such a solid foundation that it survive some weak element that would have undermine a lesser film besides the painfully obvious aircraft model mention before the weak moment include a couple of scene shoot on cheap indoor set with fake snow as well as two other scene involve bat and wolf that seem unnecessary in an already action pack narrative finally Harlin 's decision to film some of the death scene in slow motion seem pointless since the technique contribute nothing to the scene it be a shame that Stallone be now too old for action movie because his character in this movie seem so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like year later but perhaps it be good that stand on its own for all time without a sequel there be enough tired and obsolete movie franchise already there be an unofficial sequel that call itself vertical limit compare to that clinker belong on the 's top list rate 8 Very good especially consider most of Stallone 's other movie",1

"now this be what I will call a good horror with occult supernatural undertone this nice low budget French movie catch my attention from the very first scene this prove you do n't need wild FX or lot of gore to make an effective horror movie the plot revolve around 4 cellmate in a prison and each of these character and their motive become gradually more interesting as the movie build up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eye of Carrere who have just enter prison and have to get use to live with these 3 other inmate I wo n't say much because this movie really deserve to be more widely see there a few flaw though the FX be not that good but they be use effectively the plot leave some mystery open and thing get very confusing towards the end but redeem itself by the time it be over I think his be a very good movie 8",1

"aside from a few title and the new Sherlock Holmes movie I think I have watch every movie Guy Ritchie have direct twice needless to say I be a big fan and be one of the highlight reason why this movie be a very different approach from Ritchie when you look at it comparatively with Lock Stock and set us up for a psychological thriller of sort as a gambling con find himself at the mercy of a set of foe he do n't expect and a guide walk for redemption that he do n't know he need along with see Benjamin of fame strut his act ability other standout act be Ray Liotta play the maniacal Mr D Macha and Mark Strong play the hit man after be send to prison by a tyrannous casino owner Macha Jake use his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate Macha and force his hand in compensate him for the seven year he spend when he win a card game and amass a decent sum from Macha Jake find himself on the brink of death as he collapse and be diagnose with an incurable disease that have leave him with three day to live a team of loan shark however have an answer for him and a ticket to life only if he give them all the money he have and relent to work for them all in a ploy to both take Macha down and show Jake how dangerous he have make himself to himself along with have the air of death loom and a pair of loan shark have a field day with his money Jake also have to deal with have a hit put out on him which introduce a hit man under Macha 's employ the depth with the story come when Jake realize that some Co convict he spend time with in solitary may very well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he have by craft all of the unfortunate event that Jake seem to find his way into when face with this reality though Zack Vincent Pastore and Avi show Jake just how twisted he have become from be in solitary have only the company of his mind and his ego then make it so that their actual existence be elusive even to Jake the movie unravel to a humble process for both Jake and Macha as they both come to grip with their inner demon the style of the movie be top notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represent and the character it include although a lot of nod at Ritchie 's previous film be here it still have a presence of its own from the dialogue the set and the experimental take on the gangster genre it be also a great trip on humility and recognize when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should the character be well craft in this movie with all side be flesh out and true to Ritchie fashion they be all tie in by some underhandedness that throw a wrench in everyone 's affair I could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuance but I do n't want to take too much away from it if you have n't see it yet it may take a few sitting to get through all the intricate layer but it be a great movie and it should be see if you be lucky and you have n't see the water down US release see if you can get the original UK version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friend as you try to puzzle in your take I see it with my crew around early and we be still talk about it with little thing we have pick up on today it have garner its cult status and it be well deserve as the film where Ritchie step out the box and break his norm a bit Line fear or revere me but please think I be special we share an addiction we be approval junkie",1

"if you be a fan of Altman 's large ensemble cast as evidence in major film like M A S H Nashville Park and lesser seen film like a wedding then you will no doubt be entertain by Health around a Health Convention where two woman be run for President Health contain many of Altman 's latter regular like Paul Dooley who help write the film Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson while also include top star Altman newcomer like Lauren Bacall James Garner and Glenda Jackson like a lot of Altman ensemble film there be numerous subplot in this film but it be not nearly as overwhelm as film like Nashville or a wedding rather it have a more center feel perhaps like M A S H or Park the whole thing be an obvious satire on the Health movement fill with over top outlandish contradictive character with guest star like Dick Cavett provide a wry commentary on the whole thing underline the whole election process be Altman 's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what be most appealing about this film be the sheer fun most people seem to be have this would be one of Altman 's last film like this for a while",1
"I have just finish watch this film and I can honestly say that this be a work of art I be very surprise to see the overall rating as 5 2 not only do Guy bring together a b list movie cast and make them into such glorious character he have give us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much leave to the imagination far too many people be want movie with a plot that can be understand and hand to them on a plate yet these be the film that get poor review because they be far too predictable this film be special get it now",1
"I be give ten out of ten it be one of the good movie ever absolutely smash stun and daze by the whole picture marvellous playing of Jason Statham Ray Liotta and all the crew amazing plot just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit it touch your soul because it be strange but there be all the answer you have be ever look for the very good Mr Ritchie THE Best those who be look for a simple and skirmish keep yell they be disappointed but there be lot of shallow movie in Hollywood nowadays you ca n't remember what it be about the next day you have see it on the contrary revolver be unique I could have hardly expect it be possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself of everyone who be to watch it absolutely unsurpassed astound dazzling one can get insight watch this I have no doubt about that actually no word can express my admiration I be still wonder how it be possible to shoot such a movie after year of giddy Hollywood rubbish we have be watch thank you from all heart it be simply the good",1

"I have never know of a film to arouse such debate in my life me when i say that this film will eventually be remember as an all time classic I be wait in anticipation for this film as i have previously love both Lock Stock and but after some of the negative review i think i would be very disappoint I absolutely love this film and i ca n't wait to see it again this film be totally different to both of the aforementioned Ritchie film and also a lot well I have my pick of favourite director but none of them have pull off a move as great as Guy Ritchie have just do with this movie I believe he have take movie make to another level i know most people will be laugh at this comment the reaction to this film but i believe time will prove me right this movie be very confusing and carry on for much long than the or so run time as i could n't stop think about it or try to piece thing together I have now get a pretty good take on everything that happen in this film some answer from endless hour of think some answer from read other people 's take on the film and now can wait until Sunday when i will see it again I just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be reward as i and many other have be",1
"have read the review for this film I understandably start watch it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good however this be one of the good film i have see in a long time the majority of review that i have read say that the complicated plot make it too hard to follow and whilst some part do leave you confuse the end tie up so many loose end that you feel like kick yourself because you have miss so much it be not like Lock Stock or in the sense that it be n't that funny in fact it be pretty dark and it be a lot more intelligent in the way that you see part of scene from different viewpoint and in one of the good scene of the film Jason Statham spend five minute in a lift have an argument with himself the way in which it be similar to the two film i just mention be that it be full of memorable character specifically Statham who give a fantastic performance as the lead and Ray Liotta who spend most of the film in but give a great performance none the less if you have get time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hint that be lay out through the film I think it be fantastic and that Guy Ritchie be a director on top of his game",1
"I will start by say that this have undeservedly be pan by just about everyone the fact be it be n't what anyone be expect especially from Guy Ritchie What everyone be expect be cockney geezer and good one liner do like dag etc but this be far more mature than his previous work I would agree that it be confusing but all the fact be there for us we just have to see them and listen harder this film demand all your attention look past the cool and dazzling look of the film try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performance and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film Yes this have its influence from modern classic fight club pulp fiction etc but it be in the whole original in both direction and pace with a music score second to none I feel that if everyone watch this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it be and i hope also that Ritchie continue in this vain as i far prefer this to his masterpiece",1
"first of all do n't go into expect another or Lock Stock this be a different sort of gangster film I see the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience it be the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what be that that be awful and the other half will leave thinking what be that that be cool personally i like film that i do n't understand i e Drive and so i enjoy it definitely be n't perfect though I see the big twist come a mile away at least part of it and though sometimes some loose end leave unexplained be good leave a lot of question unexplained for no reason it seem also some scene like the animation and the scene where go on a kill spree actually one of my favourite although awesome scene to watch seem to just be there because they be awesome to watch not because they fit in with the movie However there be many good thing too I think the acting be superb from all the main actor Jason Ray Liotta Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin who be a pleasant surprise this movie definitely keep my interest with one great suspenseful action pack scene after another when Ray Liotta be be hold under the table wow well you have to see it the script be extremely well do and the soundtrack as with most Guy Ritchie film be great though a step below such movie as fight Club Drive and suspect it be still an awesome fast pace psychological action movie with many twist and turn and ton of scene you will remember long after the movie be over",1
"I watch to movie today and it just blow my mind away it be a real masterpiece of art and I do n't understand why most of the people think it be garbage the main idea of the movie take your ego away and then you will have true power this be the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie have show that in a magnificent way the great enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look do you remember this from the movie because our true enemy be in us it be our ego that voice that always tell us that we be important that give us our pride that tell us not to give but only to take that create our aggression that want to be in control that create all the negative feeling and thought Gr express this idea in an astonishing way and have show that the only way to gain true control be when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance a superb movie",1
"I always enjoy see movie that make you think and do n't just drip feed the answer to their audience be one of these film and although many reviewer have state that it be difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind I get it first time True it do n't compare to other mind muck like the usual or but in its own right its an intelligent and think provoking film another thing I really like about this film be how damn beautiful it be every scene every camera angle seem to have be think about for age if you see it you will know what I mean so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well no one ever say be for everyone and that be my 2 cent",1
"in the classic sense of the four humor which be not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment Altman 's H E A L T H treat all of the humor and actually in very funny entertaining way there be the Phlegm as personify by Lauren Bacall 's very slow guarded and protective character Esther Brill who be mission in life appear to be all about appearance protect the secret of her age and beauty more than her well be there be Paul Dooley 's Dr Gil Gainey who like a fish out of water perhaps more like a seal flop around frenetically bark and exhort the crowd to subscribe to his aquatic madness the of Glenda Jackson 's Isabella smack of Shakespeare 's troubled and self righteous Hamlet even proffer a soliloquy or two and let be not forget Henry Gibson 's character Bobby Hammer the breast that feed the baby rule the world then there be the character Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank James Garner and Carol Burnett respectively relatively sane character strive to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humor who have convene for H E A L T H a kind of world trade organization specialize in H E A L T H which be to say anything but health this be Altman at his classic good",1
"first of all when people hear Guy Ritchie they immediately think of Yes be a good movie but the problem be that everyone associate Guy Ritchie to they do n't expect him to explore new frontier this movie revolver be different than snatch it be much dark and be very complex the reason I give a rating of be because I have have to watch 3 time to understand everything so this movie toy with your head it be very cleverly write this movie be different than it be do wonderfully the cinematography be beautiful and you can recognize Guy Ritchie 's personal touch style of direct in it What win me over be the complexity of the protagonist and how we be leave with more question than answer",1
"OK this movie so far have be slate by critic and board poster alike although play devil 's advocate you could suggest that critic be often people who do n't make it for themselves as film maker and board poster be often people who do n't make it for themselves as critic so I want to sit in Guy 's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who have decide not to see the film base on how everybody seem to be look down their collective nose of approval at it the film 's big flaw in earn wide support be how unexpectedly complex it be this have be describe many time as as make the film inaccessible to the viewer the film 's chronology be relatively non linear and the character be use as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for show us the subtle or not so subtle hint of bias we give thing as we commit them to memory Ie Ray Liotta 's character brandish a gun say the word fear me be portray as both tragically pathetic from Statham 's Pov or interrogate and bold from Liotta 's Pov This be but one example of Ritchie be far more mature approach he have take to film make with we have a storyline which be pretty archetypal the strong but silent gritty anti hero get release from jail with a score to settle but get draw inadvertently into a world of corruption I mean it be paint by number film noir here guy all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice over but then Guy have take this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex point take the scene where Jason Statham 's character run afoul of a car this throwaway sequence could have be emit from the film and make no difference to the story whatsoever but Ritchie be make point about how such little chance happening such as receive a phone call can make the difference between life and death so the final act of the movie be pretty mind boggle I will be take the p if I say I do n't spend the last minute or so of the film turn to my date go uh but that be the shoddy reason to disregard a piece of art it be far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand and even easy to say well nobody else seem to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film in my humble opinion be a stylish complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greet with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers if we choose this opportunity to collectively say ah t I want a film about a load of bleeding cockney gangster in nit loll Guy Ritchie be a tit then the day will come when film maker be allow only to make that which be expect of them by shallow people just because Guy make a name for himself with funny cheeky cockney romp do n't mean he ca n't be deep without be pretentious funny people can be thoughtful too",1
